We \\nwere in the midst of the most devastating downturn in nearly a century.  I came into office de -\\ntermined to fundamentally change things, by rebuilding our economy from the middle out and \\nbottom up, not the top down—because when the middle class does well, the poor have a ladder \\nup and the wealthy still do well.  We all do.  We can give everyone a fair shot and leave no one \\nbehind.\\nOur work started with the American Rescue Plan, which vaccinated the Nation, delivered \\nimmediate economic relief to people who badly needed it, and sent funding to States and cities \\nto keep key services going.  It continued with the biggest investment in our Nation’s infrastruc -\\nture since the 1950s.  More than 46,000 new projects have been announced to date, rebuilding \\nour roads, bridges, railroads, ports, airports, public transit, water systems, high-speed internet, \\nand more.  At the same time, we are making the most significant investment in fighting climate \\nchange in the history of the world.  I have seen Americans’ courage and resilience in the wake \\nof devastating natural disasters, and I will always have their backs as we rebuild and boost \\nresilience to extreme weather.  We are building a cleaner, more resilient and sustainable power \\ngrid, and making America’s biggest investment in rural electricity since the New Deal.  We are \\nrevitalizing fence-line communities that have shouldered the burden of harmful pollution for \\ngenerations.  We are lowering energy costs for hardworking families and strengthening our \\nenergy security with clean energy breakthroughs.  Across the board, we are supporting ad -\\nvanced manufacturing, ensuring the industries of the future are made in America by American \\nworkers. \\nOur plan is working.  Already, my Investing in America agenda has attracted $650 billion in \\nprivate investment from companies that are building factories and moving production back to \\nAmerica.  We are making things here in America again, with American union workers.  We have \\nignited a manufacturing boom, a semiconductor boom, an electric-vehicle boom, and more.  My \\nagenda is creating hundreds of thousands of union jobs, so folks never have to leave their home -\\ntowns to find good-paying work they can raise a family on.  Today, America once again has the \\nstrongest economy in the world.  We have created a record 15 million jobs, with unemployment \\nunder four percent for the longest stretch in over 50 years.  Growth is strong.  Wages are rising \\nand inflation is down by two-thirds, with costs having fallen for key household items from a \\ngallon of gas to a gallon of milk.  We have more to do, but folks are starting to feel the benefits.  \\nConsumer sentiment has surged more in recent months than any time in 30 years.  Americans \\nhave filed a record 16 million new business applications since I took office; each one of them is \\nan act of hope. \\nImportantly, we made these historic investments in a fiscally responsible way, while making \\nour tax system fairer.  In 2022, I signed a law that imposed a new minimum tax of 15 percent \\non the Nation’s largest corporations, saved $160 billion by giving Medicare the authority to ne -\\ngotiate prescription drug prices and limit price increases, and boosted funding to the Internal \\nRevenue Service to crack down on wealthy and corporate tax cheats.  This is just the beginning. \\nMy Budget would do more to close loopholes.  It would save another $200 billion by enabling THE BUDGET MESSAGE OF THE PRESIDENT\\nTo The Congress  of The UniTed sTaTes:2 THe BUDGeT MeSSAGe OF THe PReSIDeNT\\nMedicare to negotiate prices on even more drugs and by limiting other drug price increases.  It \\nwould cut wasteful subsidies to Big Oil and other special interests; and it would introduce a \\nminimum tax on billionaires, which alone would raise $500 billion for the American people. \\nSo far, we have already cut the deficit by $1 trillion since I took office, one of the biggest reductions \\nin history, and I have signed legislation to cut it by $1 trillion more.  My Budget would reduce it by \\nanother $3 trillion over the next 10 years as well, while continuing to pay for our investments in \\nAmerica.\\nAnd we are just getting started.\\nMy Administration will keep fighting to lower costs for working families, on everything from hous -\\ning to childcare to student loans.  After decades of talk in Washington, we beat Big Pharma and \\ncapped the cost of insulin for seniors at $35 a month, down from as much as $400.  Starting next year, \\nno senior on Medicare will pay more than $2,000 a year in total out-of-pocket prescription drug costs, \\neven for expensive cancer medications that now cost many times more.  We are cracking down on \\nprice gouging by requiring drugmakers that raise prices of certain drugs faster than inflation to pay a \\nrebate back to Medicare.  At the same time, we have protected and expanded the Affordable Care Act, \\nwith a record 21 million Americans enrolled in marketplace plans this past year, while saving millions \\nof Americans $800 per year on their premiums.  Today, more Americans have health insurance than \\never before.  My Budget builds on those gains. \\nI also know that for too many hardworking families, it costs too much to find a good home, \\nso we are working to lower costs and boost supply of housing nationwide.  My Budget will \\nmake monthly mortgage payments more affordable for middle-class first-time homebuyers by \\nproviding a $5,000 annual mortgage relief credit for two years.  My Budget will expand rental \\nassistance to hundreds of thousands of additional families, continuing the largest expansion \\nin 20 years.  It will also help to ease America’s longstanding shortage of affordable housing, \\nincluding by cutting red tape, so that more builders can get Federal financing to build more af -\\nfordable housing.  Important progress is underway: more families own homes today than before \\nthe pandemic; rents are easing; and a record 1.7 million housing units are under construction \\nnationwide.\\nMy Budget also makes key investments in childcare and education, so every child in America \\ncan have the strong start they need to thrive.  It restores the Child Tax Credit expansion I signed \\ninto law, which cut child poverty nearly in half in 2021; and it guarantees the vast majority of \\nfamilies high-quality childcare for no more than $10 a day, while boosting pay for childcare work -\\ners.  It offers universal free preschool for all four million of America’s four-year-olds.  Building on \\nthe American Rescue Plan’s investment in public education, the biggest in history, it also helps \\nStates expand tutoring, afterschool, and summer programs; and boosts recruiting to ease teacher \\nshortages. \\nAt the same time, I am keeping my promise to ease the crushing burden of student debt.  \\nDespite legal challenges, we have canceled some $138 billion in student debt for nearly four mil -\\nlion Americans, including more than 750,000 teachers, nurses, firefighters, social workers, and \\nother public servants.  That is freeing people to finally consider buying a home, having a child, \\nor starting that small business they always dreamed of.\\nWe are also working to secure our border.  In October, I sent an emergency request for more \\nfunding; my Budget renews that request for additional resources, including for 1,300 more \\nBorder Patrol agents, 375 immigration judges, and 1,600 asylum officers, and for cutting-edge \\ntechnology to help detect fentanyl.  We need to pass the Senate’s bipartisan border deal as well, BUDGeT OF THe U. S. GOVeRNMeNT FOR FISCAL YeAR 2025 3\\nwhich would make urgent additional investments to secure the border and help to fix our broken \\nimmigration system.   \\nToday, the world is facing an inflection point in history, at home and abroad.  My Administration \\nhas restored America’s leadership on the world stage, rallying more than 50 nations to support \\nUkraine in the face of brutal Russian aggression, strengthening and expanding NATO, revital -\\nizing our alliances and partnerships in the Indo-Pacific—including with Japan, South Korea, \\nand Australia—and strengthening democracy across the globe.  But we need to do more to prove \\nthat America can once again be relied on to stand up for freedom.  In October, I submitted a na -\\ntional security supplemental request to cover urgent needs, including support for Ukraine and \\nIsrael, and humanitarian aid and relief for Palestinians.  My Budget reiterates that request and \\ncontinues other critical support for NATO allies and partners around the world.  It strengthens \\nour deterrence capacity in the Indo-Pacific, expanding our capabilities in the region.  It also \\nworks to keep our military the best-trained, best-equipped fighting force in the world, integrat -\\ning advanced innovation technologies, and improving overall readiness.  My Budget also takes \\nimportant steps to honor our Nation’s most sacred obligation—to protect and equip our troops \\nwhen they are in harm’s way, and to care for them and their families throughout and after their \\nservice.  Since I took office, I have signed over 30 significant bipartisan bills to support veterans, \\nincluding the PACT Act, the biggest-ever expansion of benefits for servicemembers exposed to \\ntoxic burn pits during their service; and I have issued the most comprehensive executive actions \\nto date to boost economic security for military families.  My Budget builds on that work.\\nThe story of America is one of progress and resilience, of always moving forward and never \\ngiving up. It is a story unique among nations.  We are the only nation that has emerged from \\nevery crisis we have entered stronger than we went in.  While my Administration has seen great \\nprogress since day one, there is still work to do.  My Budget will help make that promise real.\\n     JOSePH R. BIDeN JR.\\nThe WhiTe hoUse,\\n   March 20245BUILDING THE ECONOMY FROM THE \\nMIDDLE OUT AND BOTTOM UP\\nWhen the President and Vice President came \\ninto office, America faced historic challenges, \\nincluding a once-in-a-century pandemic and an \\neconomy experiencing the most severe downturn \\nsince the Great Depression.  From day one, the \\nPresident moved swiftly to tackle these challeng -\\nes head-on and has delivered long-lasting results.  \\nOver the past three years, the President has \\noverseen a strong economic recovery, amassed \\none of the most successful legislative records \\nin generations, sought to grow the economy by \\ngrowing the middle class, and delivered impor -\\ntant progress for the American people.\\nSince the President took office, the economy \\nhas added about 15 million jobs.  That is about \\n15 million additional Americans who know the \\npeace of mind that comes with a paycheck.  The \\nunemployment rate has remained below four \\npercent for 24 months in a row—a more than 50-\\nyear record—while inflation has fallen by two-\\nthirds.  Our strong labor market has meant high -\\ner paychecks, driven by pay increases across the \\nmiddle class.  Workers’ paychecks and household \\nwealth are higher now than they were before the \\npandemic—including after adjusting for infla -\\ntion.  Higher pay has spurred strong consumer \\nspending and business investment.  Americans \\nhave filed a record 16 million applications to \\nstart businesses—the highest number ever over \\na three-year span.  Under President Biden, the \\nNation has achieved faster growth than any of \\nAmerica’s peer nations and now has the lowest \\ncore inflation of almost any other major economy.The President’s top economic priority is low -\\nering costs for hardworking Americans.  The \\nAdministration is working to bring down pre -\\nscription drug costs, health insurance premiums, \\nutility bills, and costs for everyday goods—all \\nwhile taking on junk fees that some airlines, \\nbanks, and other companies use to rip off \\nAmericans. \\nThe President has lowered costs while in -\\nvesting in America and the American people.  \\nThe President’s Investing in America agenda, \\nwhich includes his landmark legislation—\\nthe Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act \\n(Bipartisan Infrastructure Law), the CHIPS \\nand Science Act (Public Law 117-167), and the \\nInflation Reduction Act (Public Law 117-169)—\\nis driving record investment and opportunity \\nin communities across the Nation, including \\nthose that have been too often left behind.  The \\nPresident has led a historic economic recovery, \\nimplemented the Investing in America agenda, \\nand worked to lower costs for Americans, while \\nalso keeping Americans safe and promoting de -\\nmocracy at home and abroad.\\nAs the President said, “the story of America \\nis a story of progress and resilience, of always \\nmoving forward, of never, ever giving up.  It’s a \\nstory unique among all nations.  We’re the only \\ncountry that has emerged from every crisis we’ve \\never entered stronger than we got into it.”  Under \\nthe President’s leadership, the Administration is \\nfocused on building on this record of progress as \\nwe write the next chapter in the great American \\nstory.6 BUILDING THe eCONOMY FROM THe MIDDLe OUT AND BOTTOM UP\\nLOWERING COSTS AND PUTTING MONEY BACK IN AMERICANS’ POCKETS\\nOver the past three years, the global pandem -\\nic and Putin’s illegal war against the people of \\nUkraine have led to inflation all over the world.  \\nThe President has made it his top domestic prior -\\nity to lower costs and give American families more \\nbreathing room.  Under the President’s leader -\\nship, the Nation has seen significant progress in \\nbringing down inflation.  Over the last six months \\nof 2023, core inflation was at the pre-COVID-19 \\npandemic benchmark of two percent—with aver -\\nage hourly earnings adjusted for inflation higher \\nnow than before the COVID-19 pandemic and ris -\\ning faster than inflation over the last year.  The \\nAdministration has consistently taken steps to \\nlower a range of costs and put more money back \\ninto American’s pockets.\\nLowering Healthcare Costs\\nThe President signed into law the historic \\nInflation Reduction Act, which is helping millions \\nof Americans save an average of $800 per year \\non health insurance by extending the Patient \\nProtection and Affordable Care Act (Affordable \\nCare Act) enhanced premium tax credit, helping \\ndrive enrollment in Affordable Care Act health \\ninsurance to record-breaking highs.  The historic \\nlegislation also capped the cost of insulin at $35 a \\nmonth for seniors per insulin prescription, made \\nrecommended vaccines free, and is requiring drug \\ncompanies to pay rebates to Medicare if they raise \\nprices faster than inflation.  Under the President’s \\nleadership, the Administration has taken on Big \\nPharma to finally allow Medicare to negotiate for \\nlower prescription drug prices—starting with ten \\nof the costliest, most widely used drugs used to \\ntreat blood clots, cancers, arthritis, diabetes, and \\nmore.  The Administration has also cracked down \\non surprise medical bills, preventing Americans \\nfrom receiving more than one million surprise \\nmedical bills every month, and is also including \\nan allowance to ban unwarranted “facility fees” \\nfor telehealth and certain other outpatient ser -\\nvices in commercial insurance.Bringing Down Energy \\nand Internet Costs\\nThe President has taken action to bring gas \\nprices down—since their peak, average gas prices \\nfor Americans have come down more than $1.60 \\nper gallon.  The President’s historic Inflation \\nReduction Act is directly investing in communi -\\nties while also spurring hundreds of billions of \\ndollars in private sector investment—in wind, so -\\nlar, energy efficiency, electric vehicles, and more—\\ncreating economic opportunities, lowering energy \\ncosts across the Nation, and improving public \\nhealth.  The Inflation Reduction Act is expected \\nto help families save an average of $500 per year \\non energy costs once fully implemented.  The \\nPresident’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law cre -\\nated the Affordable Connectivity Program, which \\nhas helped 23 million households save more than \\n$500\\xa0million per month on internet bills. \\nForgiving Historic Amounts of \\nStudent Debt and Launching the Most \\nAffordable Repayment Plan Ever\\nThe President has made history by approving \\na total of over $137\\xa0billion in debt cancellation for \\nover 3.7 million Americans through a variety of \\nactions, including by taking on private, for-profit \\nuniversities that have scammed hard-working \\nAmericans.  The Administration launched the \\nmost affordable student loan repayment plan \\never—the Saving on a Valuable education plan—\\nwhich will cut undergraduate loan payments \\nin half and prevent student loan balances from \\ngrowing due to runaway interest.  To alleviate \\nthe burden of student loan debt for hard-working \\npublic servants, the Administration has helped \\nalmost 750,000 people access Public Service Loan \\nForgiveness (PSLF).  Prior to the Administration’s \\nfixes to PSLF, only about 7,000 borrowers had re -\\nceived forgiveness.  The President has also signed \\nlegislation increasing the maximum Pell Grant by \\n$900 since the beginning of the Administration—\\nthe largest increase in nearly 10 years—making \\ncollege more affordable. BUDGeT OF THe U. S. GOVeRNMeNT FOR FISCAL YeAR 2025 7\\nLowering Housing Costs\\nThe President and Vice President understand \\nthat housing affordability remains a challenge \\nfor too many families.  However, we are making \\nprogress:  homeownership is higher now than it \\nwas before the COVID-19 pandemic, including \\nfor African Americans and Hispanic Americans; \\nrental costs have moderated in the last year; \\nand a record number of apartments are under \\nconstruction—which should ease the burden of \\nhousing costs going forward.  With the Housing \\nSupply Action Plan, the Administration is mak -\\ning progress toward reducing the growth of hous -\\ning costs by increasing supply, including through \\nreducing barriers to housing and offering new \\nand improved financing for affordable housing \\ndevelopment.  In 2023, the Administration low -\\nered Federal Housing Administration annual \\nmortgage insurance premiums by about one-\\nthird, saving more than 400,000 Americans—in -\\ncluding many first-time homebuyers—approxi -\\nmately $800 over the first year of the mortgage \\nwith continued savings in subsequent years.  To \\nlower rental costs for those who need it most, the \\nAdministration has secured rental assistance for \\nover 100,000 additional low-income households \\nfor the Housing Choice Voucher program, guar -\\nanteeing rents at 30 percent of those families’ \\nincomes. \\nTaking on Junk Fees\\nJunk fees are hidden, surprise fees that compa -\\nnies sneak onto customer bills, costing American \\nfamilies tens of billions of dollars each year and \\nstifling competition across the economy.  The \\nPresident has taken junk fees head on by direct -\\ning his Administration to use every available tool \\nto address them and lower costs for the American \\npeople—including by cracking down on hidden \\njunk fees in airline tickets, banking, investment \\nadvice, health insurance, and apartment rent -\\nals.  The Administration has pushed banks to \\nreduce overdraft and bounced check fees, saving consumers more than $5\\xa0billion a year compared \\nto pre-COVID-19 pandemic.  The Federal Trade \\nCommission has proposed rules to ban companies \\nfrom charging hidden and misleading fees and re -\\nquire them to show the full price up front, and to \\nrequire sellers to make it as easy for consumers \\nto cancel their enrollment as it was to sign up—\\nrescuing consumers from difficulties cancelling \\nunwanted subscriptions like gym memberships.  \\nThe Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has \\nproposed a rule that would\\xa0 lower credit card late \\nfees\\xa0from approximately $30 to $8, saving consum -\\ners up to $9\\xa0billion annually.  To help stop conduct \\nlike price fixing or price gouging in grocery stores, \\nthe Department of Agriculture has announced a \\nnew partnership with bipartisan State attorneys \\ngeneral.  In addition, the Department of Housing \\nand Urban Development has called on industry, \\nhousing providers, and State and local govern -\\nments to adopt policies that promote greater fair -\\nness and transparency of fees faced by renters. \\nTaking on Unfair Wage Practices to \\nPut Money Back in Americans’ Pockets\\nThe Biden-Harris Administration has re -\\ncovered more than $770\\xa0 million for more than \\n485,000 workers across the Nation by enforc -\\ning laws that protect these workers from being \\nvictims of wage theft and exploitation, includ -\\ning when they were not paid minimum wages \\nor hard-earned overtime wages, were denied \\ntheir tips, or were misclassified as independent \\ncontractors.  The Administration has proposed \\na new rule to extend overtime pay for up to an \\nadditional 3.6 million workers by raising the in -\\ncome threshold, meaning workers like fast-food \\nmanagers or executive assistants could get their \\nwell-deserved overtime pay.  In addition, the Vice \\nPresident announced the publication of a final \\nrule that will raise wage standards of construc -\\ntion workers by updating prevailing wage regu -\\nlations, affecting more than one million workers \\nconstructing $200\\xa0 billion in federally funded or \\nassisted projects.8 BUILDING THe eCONOMY FROM THe MIDDLe OUT AND BOTTOM UP\\nDelivering on a Commitment \\nto Fiscal Responsibility\\nThe deficit is over $1\\xa0trillion lower than when \\nPresident Biden took office, thanks in large part \\nto a strong economic recovery facilitated by in -\\nvestments that have expanded the Nation’s pro -\\nductive capacity and a historic vaccination pro -\\ngram that allowed the responsible wind-down of \\nemergency measures.  In addition, the President \\nhas also enacted another roughly $1\\xa0 trillion \\nin savings over the next decade through the \\nFiscal Responsibility Act of 2023, and through \\nthe Inflation Reduction Act provisions that em -\\npower Medicare to negotiate lower prescription \\ndrug prices, cap insulin at $35 per month for se -\\nniors,\\xa0and make the wealthy and large corpora -\\ntions pay more of their fair share.  To address the \\nunfairness of 55 of the most profitable U.S. cor -\\nporations paying zero dollars in Federal income \\ntaxes, the President signed into law a 15-percent minimum tax on the profits of the largest corpo -\\nrations—those with over $1\\xa0billion in profits.  He \\nalso signed into law a surcharge on corporate stock \\nbuybacks, which encourages businesses to invest \\nin their growth and productivity as opposed to \\nfunneling tax-preferred profits to wealthy share -\\nholders.  The Inflation Reduction Act also enact -\\ned long-overdue investments in rebuilding and \\nmodernizing the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), \\nwhich raise revenue by making wealthy taxpay -\\ners and big corporations pay the taxes they owe—\\nwhile improving customer service and without \\nincreasing audit rates relative to historical levels \\nfor small businesses and taxpayers making under \\n$400,000 per year.  The Budget would build on \\nthis progress by increasing the corporate mini -\\nmum tax rate to 21 percent, quadrupling the sur -\\ncharge on stock buybacks, extending the IRS in -\\nvestment, and other important reforms, resulting \\nin about $3 trillion of deficit reduction even after \\nfinancing the Budget’s investments. \\nINVESTING IN AMERICA AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE\\nAs the President takes action to lower costs \\nand grow the economy from the middle out and \\nbottom up, he is also investing in America and the \\nAmerican people—expanding access to health -\\ncare and improving women’s health, building \\nthe next generation of American infrastructure, \\nempowering American workers and families, ad -\\nvancing equity across the Nation, delivering on \\nthe most ambitious climate agenda in history, \\nand ensuring the dignity of honoring America’s \\nsacred obligation to its veterans. \\nExpanding Access to Healthcare\\nThe President believes healthcare is a right, \\nnot a privilege.  The Administration continues \\nto build on and strengthen the Affordable Care \\nAct—and Americans are enrolled in record num -\\nbers.  A record-breaking 21.3 million Americans \\nsigned up for healthcare coverage through the \\nAffordable Care Act Marketplaces for 2024, an in -\\ncrease of more than nine million people since the \\nPresident took office.  In addition, over one million \\npeople in the four States that have adopted the Affordable Care Act’s Medicaid expansion under \\nthe President’s watch have gained Medicaid cov -\\nerage, many for the first time.  The Vice President \\nhas also continued her leadership on addressing \\nthe maternal health crisis and its disparate im -\\npacts, particularly on Black women.  Since taking \\noffice, over 40 States have answered her call to \\nextend Medicaid postpartum coverage from two \\nmonths to 12—expanding access to this essential \\ncare for mothers across the Nation. \\nInvesting in Women’s Health Research\\nDespite making up more than half the popula -\\ntion, women have historically been understudied \\nand underrepresented in health research.  This \\nlack of investment limits the understanding of \\nconditions that are specific to women, predomi -\\nnantly affect women, or affect women differently.  \\nIn order to give women and their healthcare pro -\\nviders the tools and information that they need \\nto more effectively prevent, diagnose, and treat \\nthese conditions, the President and First Lady \\nlaunched the first-ever White House Initiative on \\nWomen’s Health Research—which will galvanize BUDGeT OF THe U. S. GOVeRNMeNT FOR FISCAL YeAR 2025 9\\nthe Federal Government and the private and \\nphilanthropic sectors to spur innovation, unleash \\ntransformative investment to close research gaps, \\nand improve women’s health.\\nDefending and Protecting \\nReproductive Rights and Healthcare\\nTwenty-seven million women of reproductive \\nage—more than one in three—live in one of the \\n21 States with an abortion ban currently in effect.  \\nIn the last year, women have been denied medi -\\ncal care needed to preserve their health and save \\ntheir lives.  In the wake of the Supreme Court’s \\ndecision to overturn nearly 50 years of precedent \\nin Roe v. Wade, the President has signed executive \\nOrders to:  protect access to abortion, including \\nmedication abortion; strengthen access to con -\\ntraception; help ensure women receive the medi -\\ncal care they need in an emergency; and support \\nwomen’s ability to travel across State lines to ac -\\ncess care.  The Administration has also strength -\\nened privacy protections for patients and doctors, \\nand defended in court women’s ability to access \\nmedication abortion and emergency medical care \\nrequired under Federal law.  The Administration \\ncontinues to call on the Congress to pass legisla -\\ntion restoring the protections of Roe v. Wade  in \\nFederal law.\\nEnsuring Robust Access to \\nMental Healthcare\\nThe President believes mental health is health, \\nparticularly given the unprecedented mental \\nhealth crisis impacting people of all ages that was \\nexacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic.  As part \\nof the Administration’s Unity Agenda, President \\nBiden released a comprehensive national strate -\\ngy to transform how mental health is understood, \\naccessed, treated, and integrated in and out of \\nhealthcare settings.  The Administration has \\nmade historic investments in mental healthcare, \\nincluding nearly $1\\xa0 billion to support the 988 \\nSuicide and Crisis Lifeline.  The Administration \\nis also committed to investing in training more \\nmental health professionals, and is expanding Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics \\nnationwide.  In addition, the Administration has \\ntaken action to improve and strengthen mental \\nhealth parity requirements for mental health \\nand substance use care, and ensure that more \\nthan 150 million Americans with private health \\ninsurance can better access mental health ben -\\nefits under their insurance plan.  The Biden-\\nHarris Administration is also implementing the \\nBipartisan Safer Communities Act—the single \\nlargest investment to support student mental \\nhealth in history, which will help hire and train \\nover 14,000 school-based mental health pro -\\nfessionals across the Nation.  In addition, the \\nAdministration eliminated the first three copays \\nfor mental health outpatient visits for veterans \\nusing their Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) \\nbenefits.\\nDelivering Critical Resources to \\nAddress the Overdose Epidemic\\nA key pillar of the President’s Unity Agenda, \\nthe Administration has taken action to coun -\\nter the overdose epidemic and save Americans’ \\nlives.  The Administration has made this issue a \\ntop priority, and taken historic actions over the \\npast three years to address substance use, en -\\nhance public health, strengthen public safety, \\nand save lives.  With the President’s leadership, \\nthe Administration has provided historic fund -\\ning to States, localities, and Tribes for overdose \\nprevention efforts like access to naloxone and \\ntreatment for opioid-use disorder.  In addition, \\nthe Administration requested $1.6\\xa0billion in sup -\\nplemental funding for 2024 in the Department \\nof Health and Human Services (HHS) to expand \\nsubstance use prevention, treatment, harm re -\\nduction, and recovery support services to address \\nthe overdose crisis.\\nBuilding the Next Generation \\nof American Infrastructure and \\nIgniting an Economic Resurgence\\nThe President signed the Bipartisan \\nInfrastructure Law, the largest infrastructure 10 BUILDING THe eCONOMY FROM THe MIDDLe OUT AND BOTTOM UP\\nbill since the eisenhower Administration, and \\nhas already announced $400\\xa0 billion for 40,000 \\ninfrastructure projects across 4,500 communi -\\nties throughout every State in the Nation.  This \\nincludes over $250\\xa0billion to improve transporta -\\ntion all across the Nation—from better roads and \\nbridges, to improved airports, to more reliable \\npublic transit and rail service.  The Bipartisan \\nInfrastructure Law is investing in rural commu -\\nnities alongside urban ones—it invests in afford -\\nable, reliable high-speed internet infrastructure, \\nclean drinking water, and reliable electricity. \\nThe President’s Inflation Reduction Act has \\nunleashed a manufacturing and clean energy \\nboom—spurring over $600\\xa0 billion in private \\nsector investments since taking office, includ -\\ning more than $160\\xa0 billion announced invest -\\nments in battery and eV supply chains.  Clean \\nenergy projects that have moved forward since \\nthe President signed the historic law are already \\non track to create more than 210,000 new clean \\nenergy jobs across the Nation, and are projected \\nto create more than 1.5 million additional jobs \\nover the next decade, according to estimates by \\noutside groups.  In addition, the President signed \\nthe bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act, which is \\ncreating good jobs and driving American competi -\\ntiveness in the industries of the future.  As part \\nof the implementation of the CHIPS and Science \\nAct, the Department of Commerce announced 31 \\nTech Hubs that will help communities across the \\nNation become centers of innovation critical to \\nAmerican competitiveness. \\nSupporting Workers and Building \\nPathways to Good Jobs\\nPresident Biden is the most pro-worker \\nPresident in history—and he is committed to \\nbuilding an economy from the middle out and bot -\\ntom up.  Together, he and Vice President Harris \\nhave committed to ensuring high labor standards, \\nbringing workers’ voices to the decision-making \\ntable, and enforcing rules against unfair labor \\npractices—not just here at home, but around the \\nworld.  Upholding common standards and pro -\\ntecting fundamental rights are key for American workers and American companies to compete fair -\\nly in the global economy.  The White House Task \\nForce on Worker Organizing and empowerment, \\nled by Vice President Harris, has championed the \\nAdministration’s commitment to worker rights, \\nincluding the right to a free and fair choice to join \\na union and to dignity in the workplace.  As the \\nPresident says, “unions built the middle class,” \\nand as we rebuild America, they can help rebuild \\nthe middle class in the process. \\nTo expand access to the good jobs creat -\\ned by the President’s historic legislation, the \\nAdministration has invested in pathways to jobs \\nin growing sectors, supporting both critical work -\\nforce programs at community colleges and career \\npathways programs in the K-12 system through \\nthe first-ever Career-Connected High Schools \\ngrants.  The First Lady announced the first five \\nWorkforce Hubs in cities with significant public- \\nand private-sector investments and a new initia -\\ntive to expand pathways to careers in advanced \\nmanufacturing, resulting in the launch of new \\nRegistered Apprenticeships, community college, \\nand high school programs and partnerships to \\nprovide opportunities for more Americans to pur -\\nsue careers in the industries that will continue to \\nfuel the economy.\\nRebuilding Supply Chains\\nWhen the President took office, supply chains \\nwere severely disrupted as a result of the \\nCOVID-19 pandemic.  The Administration made \\nsupply chain resilience and response a top pri -\\nority on day one, collaborating with industry \\nand labor to address acute shortages and bot -\\ntlenecks throughout the economy—and secur -\\ning critical supply chain investments through \\nthe President’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, \\nInflation Reduction Act, and bipartisan CHIPS \\nand Science Act.  As a result, critical supply \\nchains are significantly more fluid and resilient \\nthan they were when the President took office.\\xa0  \\nIn addition, the President recently announced \\na new White House Council on Supply Chain \\nResilience, which will support the enduring resil -\\nience of America’s critical supply chains.BUDGeT OF THe U. S. GOVeRNMeNT FOR FISCAL YeAR 2025 11\\nAdvancing Equity across the Nation\\nThe President signed two executive Orders \\non advancing racial equity and support for un -\\nderserved communities, providing a powerful \\nand unprecedented mandate for all Federal agen -\\ncies to launch a whole-of-Government approach \\nto equity.  Over the past three years, agencies \\nhave taken historic steps toward ensuring that \\nFederal programs are supporting communities \\nthat have been locked out of opportunity.  The \\nAdministration’s whole-of-Government work on \\nequity has included key steps to decrease the ra -\\ncial wealth gap, including by expanding Federal \\ncontracting opportunities for small disadvan -\\ntaged businesses and taking sweeping action \\nto address racial bias in home valuations to en -\\nsure that every American who buys a home has \\nthe same opportunities to build generational \\nwealth through homeownership.  In addition, the \\nAdministration has tackled gender and racial pay \\ngaps, including through salary history bans and \\npay transparency measures for Federal workers \\nand contractors.  The Administration has also de -\\nployed record investments to tribal nations and \\nNative communities, including through the his -\\ntoric American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (American \\nRescue Plan) and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.  \\nThe enactment of advance appropriations for the \\nIndian Health Service for the first time in history \\nwill help ensure more stable, predictable funding \\nand improved access to high quality healthcare.  \\nThe President also continues to expand the reach \\nof Rural Partners Network, which provides a \\ntargeted across-Government approach to access -\\ning training, technical assistance, and programs \\nto distressed rural communities, and creates a \\nclear point-of-entry for rural leaders to utilize all \\nFederal agencies’ assistance for rural areas.\\nIn executive Order 14041, “White House \\nInitiative on Advancing educational equity, \\nexcellence, and economic Opportunity through \\nHistorically Black Colleges and Universities \\n(HBCUs),” President Biden charged the initia -\\ntive to “develop new and expand pre-existing na -\\ntional networks of individuals, organizations, and \\ncommunities to share and implement adminis -\\ntrative and programmatic best practices related to advancing educational equity, excellence, and \\nopportunity at HBCUs.”  HBCUs are central to \\nthe Administration’s vision of a more inclusive, \\nequitable, and valuable higher education sys -\\ntem.  Under the President and Vice President’s \\nleadership, the Administration has secured tens \\nof billions of dollars in funding for HBCUs and \\nMinority-Serving Institutions to prepare stu -\\ndents to contribute to the future in high-demand \\nand high-income fields, like cybersecurity, en -\\ngineering, biochemistry, and healthcare.  The \\nAdministration also re-established the White \\nHouse Initiative on Advancing educational \\nequity, excellence, and economic Opportunity for \\nHBCUs to increase their participation in Federal \\nprograms that offer greater access to funding, en -\\nsuring HBCUs can continue to be engines of op -\\nportunity in the future.\\nSupporting K-12 Education\\nTo deliver on the promise of education for all \\nAmericans, the Administration secured the larg -\\nest investment in public education in history to \\nhelp students get back to school and recover aca -\\ndemically from the COVID-19 pandemic, focusing \\non evidence-based strategies such as addressing \\nchronic absenteeism and increasing student ac -\\ncess to tutoring and summer, afterschool, and \\nextended learning programs.  The President’s \\nleadership has garnered substantial increases \\nfor Federal student support programs to meet the \\nneeds of historically underserved students.  The \\nAdministration has provided record funding to \\nTitle I schools and made significant investments \\nin the Nation’s teachers.  These investments are \\nhelping States in their efforts to address teacher \\nshortages, which fall hardest on underserved stu -\\ndents.  Since the President took office, the Nation \\nhas added 73,000 public school teachers.\\nIncreasing High-Quality Care \\nand Supporting Caregivers\\nHigh-quality early care and long-term care \\nare critical to the Nation’s economic growth and \\neconomic security.  early care and education give 12 BUILDING THe eCONOMY FROM THe MIDDLe OUT AND BOTTOM UP\\nyoung children a strong start in life, while long-\\nterm care helps older Americans and people with \\ndisabilities live, work, and participate in their \\ncommunities with dignity.  Unfortunately, too \\nmany families and individuals struggle to access \\nthe affordable, high-quality care they need.  In \\nrecognition of this need, the Administration in -\\nvested over $60\\xa0billion from the American Rescue \\nPlan in the care economy, including $24\\xa0billion to \\nhelp child care providers keep their doors open \\nand to provide child care workers with higher \\npay, bonuses, and other benefits.  To date, these \\nefforts have helped over 225,000 child care pro -\\ngrams serving as many as 10 million children \\nacross the Nation. \\nThe President’s Council of economic Advisers \\nalso found that these investments saved families \\nwith young children who rely on paid child care \\napproximately $1,250 per child per year\\xa0by:  slow -\\ning the rise of child care prices; increasing the real \\nwages of child care workers by 10 percent; and \\nboosting maternal labor-force participation by up \\nto three percent, bringing hundreds of thousands \\nof mothers into the workforce.  The President \\nalso worked with the Congress to secure an ad -\\nditional $2.1\\xa0 billion in annual Child Care and \\nDevelopment Block Grant program funding since \\n2021, a 36-percent increase, to help low-income \\nworking families access the child care they need. \\nThe Administration continues to call on the \\nCongress to make significant new investments to \\ngive families in this Nation more breathing room \\nwhen it comes to care.  In April 2023, the President \\nsigned an executive Order with the most compre -\\nhensive set of executive actions any president has \\never taken to improve care for hard-working fam -\\nilies while supporting care workers and family \\ncaregivers.  executive Order 14095, “Increasing \\nAccess to High-Quality Care and Supporting \\nCaregivers” charged agencies with working with -\\nin their existing authorities to:  lower the cost of \\ncare for families; boost the supply of high-quality \\nearly care and education and long-term care; pro -\\nvide more options for individuals and families in -\\ncrease access to affordable care for families; and \\nimprove job quality and support for care workers \\nand caregivers.  Agencies have made substantial progress in implementing this executive Order.  \\nVA launched a pilot program to provide mental \\nhealth services to roughly 2,300 family caregivers \\nwho care for the Nation’s heroes.\\nHHS has proposed major rulemaking to low -\\ner costs for families receiving Federal child care \\nassistance and increase the pay for Head Start \\nteachers.  In addition, the Administration has \\nalso proposed actions to crack down on nursing \\nhomes that put seniors at risk, proposing mini -\\nmum staffing requirements that would ensure \\nevery facility has enough nurses to provide nec -\\nessary care, and expanded payments to clinicians \\nwho train caregivers for seniors and people with \\ndisabilities. \\nHonoring Our Sacred Obligation \\nto Ensure the Dignity of America’s \\nVeterans, Military Service \\nMembers, and Their Families\\nPresident Biden believes we have a sacred ob -\\nligation to care for the Nation’s veterans, their \\nfamilies, caregivers, and survivors.  Since taking \\noffice, the President has signed into law over 30 \\nbipartisan bills that address some of the most \\nimportant issues facing veterans today, includ -\\ning the Honoring our PACT Act of 2022 (PACT \\nAct), which is the most significant expansion of \\nbenefits and services for veterans exposed to toxic \\nsubstances in more than 30 years.  The biparti -\\nsan PACT Act delivers better healthcare and ben -\\nefits to veterans exposed to toxic burn pits during \\ntheir military service.  In addition, the President \\nhas called to end veterans’ homelessness—and \\nthis year alone, the Administration permanently \\nhoused over 46,000 veterans, which far exceeded \\nits goal of permanently housing 38,000 veter -\\nans.  The Administration and the Congress have \\nworked together to expand access to healthcare, \\nimprove access to child and long-term care, and \\nsupport education and workforce opportuni -\\nty for veterans and their families.  In addition, \\nthe Administration also continues to deliver on \\nveterans’ services—in 2023 alone, VA delivered \\n$163\\xa0billion in earned benefits to 6.3 million vet -\\nerans and survivors.

The \\nAdministration:  established Dependent Care \\nFlexible Spending Accounts for service members; \\nfunded universal pre-school for military children \\nliving overseas; expanded child care options for \\nmilitary families; increased the amount of child \\ncare fee assistance available to offset costs; and \\nreduced military child development center costs \\nfor lower income military families by 30 percent. \\nDelivering on the Most Ambitious \\nClimate Agenda in History  \\nSince day one, President Biden has delivered \\non the most ambitious climate, conservation, and \\nenvironmental justice agenda in history—tak -\\ning bold action to reduce climate pollution across every sector of the economy, protecting more than \\n26 million acres of lands and waters, and restor -\\ning the vital role of science in guiding Federal \\ndecision-making.  The President signed the larg -\\nest investment in climate action ever with the \\nInflation Reduction Act—resulting in 210,000 \\nnew clean energy jobs created by clean energy \\nprojects that have moved forward in the year and \\na half since the passage of the law, according to \\nestimates by outside groups.  The President has \\nalso taken bold executive action to cut emissions \\nacross the economy, including strong final stan -\\ndards to reduce methane pollution from oil and \\ngas operations.  As a result of the President’s \\nleadership and economic plan, clean energy jobs \\nare on the rise across the Nation, companies have \\nannounced hundreds of billions of dollars in clean \\nenergy investments, and the United States is on a \\npath toward cutting carbon pollution in half from \\n2005 levels by 2030 and net zero by 2050.  While \\ntackling the climate crisis, the President is using \\nthe Justice40 Initiative to embed environmental \\njustice into clean energy and climate programs, \\nensuring that communities that are on the front -\\nlines benefit from this historic investment in \\nconfronting climate pollution.  In addition, in \\nSeptember 2023, the Administration announced \\nthe launch of the American Climate Corps initia -\\ntive to mobilize a new, diverse generation of clean \\nenergy, conservation, and resilience workers to \\ntackle the climate crisis in communities around \\nthe Nation. \\nKEEPING AMERICANS SAFE AND PROTECTING \\nDEMOCRACY AT HOME AND ABROAD\\nSince the President took office, he has pro -\\ntected democracy across the globe and restored \\nU.S. leadership on the world stage.  In the wake \\nof Putin’s brutal invasion and illegal war against \\nUkraine, he has rallied the world to support \\nUkraine’s defense and stand up against dicta -\\ntorship.  The President continues to secure criti -\\ncal support for Ukraine in the face of continued \\nRussian aggression while also enhancing the col -\\nlective capabilities and readiness of the United \\nStates, our allies, and partners.  The President \\nhas strengthened alliances across the globe, including winning congressional support to add \\nFinland and Sweden to the North Atlantic Treaty \\nOrganization Alliance. \\nAfter Hamas’s horrific terrorist attacks against \\nIsrael, the President has led the United States \\nto support Israel’s right to defend its country \\nand protect its people in a way that upholds in -\\nternational humanitarian law, while ensuring \\nthe Palestinian people have access to vital hu -\\nmanitarian aid and lifesaving assistance.  The \\nPresident continues to press for congressional 14 BUILDING THe eCONOMY FROM THe MIDDLe OUT AND BOTTOM UP\\nsupport to provide the necessary security assis -\\ntance to Israel and to extend humanitarian as -\\nsistance to civilians impacted by conflict in the \\nregion, while working toward a future where \\nPalestinians have a state of their own and Israel’s \\nsecurity is assured. \\nUnder the President’s leadership, the \\nAdministration continues to focus on the Nation’s \\nstrategic competition with the People’s Republic \\nof China —and promoting American competitive -\\nness worldwide.  The President has advocated for \\ncongressional support to invest in the American \\ndefense industrial base to ensure military readi -\\nness and strengthen integrated deterrence for the \\ngrowing security requirements in the Indo-Pacific.  \\nThe President has also increased U.S. foreign as -\\nsistance to the region in support of a more free, \\nopen, secure, and connected Indo-Pacific, while \\nalso expanding America’s diplomatic presence.\\nAt the same time, the President remains laser-\\nfocused on keeping Americans safe at home.  The \\nPresident took on the gun lobby and signed the \\nBipartisan Safer Communities Act into law, the \\nfirst significant gun violence legislation in nearly \\n30 years, which includes background checks for \\nbuyers under 21, expanded mental health pro -\\ngrams, and support for implementation of red flag \\nlaws that keep guns away from dangerous people.  \\nThe President created the first-ever White House \\nOffice of Gun Violence Prevention in American \\nhistory, overseen by the Vice President, and has \\nannounced nearly 40 executive actions to keep \\nguns out of dangerous hands.  The Administration \\nhas also delivered the most funding ever for \\nthe bipartisan Violence Against Women Act \\nReauthorization Act of 2022 to combat gender-\\nbased violence and strengthened this landmark \\nlaw, in addition to issuing the Nation’s first-ever \\nU.S. National Action Plan to end Gender-Based \\nViolence.To continue to protect and secure the border, \\nthe Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has \\ntaken action to process noncitizens at record scale \\nand efficiency.  On May 12, 2023, DHS returned to \\nprocessing all noncitizens under Title 8 immigra -\\ntion authorities.  each day since then, DHS has \\nmaximized the use of expedited removal, plac -\\ning more than 900 individuals into the process \\neach day on average, and conducting more than \\n100,000 credible fear interviews, both of which \\nare record highs.  As a result, DHS has removed or \\nreturned more than 565,000 noncitizens who did \\nnot have a lawful basis to remain in the United \\nStates, the vast majority of whom crossed the \\nSouthwest land border, since May 12, 2023.  Total \\nremovals and returns since mid-May of 2023 ex -\\nceed removals and returns in every full year since \\n2013.  The majority of all individuals encountered \\nat the Southwest land border over the past three \\nyears have been removed, returned, or expelled.  \\nThe President and Vice President continue to \\ntake action to combat hate which undermines \\ndemocracy, including by releasing the first-ever \\nnational strategy to counter Antisemitism, an -\\nnouncing the development of a national strat -\\negy to counter Islamophobia and related forms \\nof bias and discrimination, signing legislation to \\nenhance State and local law enforcement’s ability \\nto respond to hate crimes, and signing legislation \\nto make lynching a Federal crime.  The President \\nand Vice President have continued to speak out \\nagainst discrimination, racism, sexism, anti-LG -\\nBTQI+ hate, and more—so that all Americans \\ncan live freely and without fear of attack or ha -\\nrassment.  To strengthen the right to vote, a key \\npillar of our democracy, the President and Vice \\nPresident have continued pushing for stronger \\nvoting rights to make sure every American can \\nmake their voice heard. 15INVESTING IN AMERICA AND \\nTHE AMERICAN PEOPLE\\nFrom the first days of the Administration, the \\nPresident has moved swiftly to deliver results for \\nthe American people.  While challenges remain, \\nAmerica has made historic progress as we con -\\ntinue to grow the economy from the middle out \\nand bottom up and ensure America can compete \\nto win in the global economy.  Since President \\nBiden took office, the economy has added about \\n15 million jobs—while core inflation fell to two \\npercent over the last six months of 2023.  The ac -\\ntions taken by the Administration have support -\\ned that progress—and set the stage for a more \\nprosperous, healthier, and safer future. \\nUnder the President’s leadership, the \\nAdministration has focused on investing in \\nAmerica and the American people, including \\nby signing into law historic legislation such \\nas the American Rescue Plan, the Bipartisan \\nInfrastructure Law, the CHIPS and Science Act, \\nand the Inflation Reduction Act.  These invest -\\nments—by supporting a manufacturing boom, \\nrevitalizing American infrastructure, expand -\\ning high-quality education and healthcare, and \\ninvesting in communities too often left behind—\\nhave helped to reverse decades of chronic under -\\nfunding of vital priorities all while supporting the \\nNation’s greatest resource:  the American people.  \\nImportantly, their gains are only beginning to be felt.  Over the coming years, the consequences \\nof these investments—and the new jobs, innova -\\ntion, and benefits they will bring—will continue \\nto spread throughout American communities \\nwith the ongoing implementation of the land -\\nmark legislation the President has signed into \\nlaw.  At the same time, they set the stage for \\ncontinued progress under the President’s leader -\\nship to lower costs, create new good-paying jobs, \\nkeep families safe and healthy, and bolster the \\nNation’s leadership on the world stage.\\nThe Budget protects and builds on this prog -\\nress with proposals for responsible, pro-growth \\ninvestments in America and the American peo -\\nple.  The Budget includes proposals that lower \\ncosts for the American people, expand access to \\nhigh-quality healthcare, support America’s work -\\nforce, confront the climate crisis, expand oppor -\\ntunity, and protect America at home and abroad.  \\nThe Budget upholds the President’s commitment \\nto protecting Medicare and Social Security for \\nthis and future generations.  The Budget builds \\non the President’s record to date while achiev -\\ning meaningful deficit reduction through mea -\\nsures that reduce wasteful spending and ask the \\nwealthy and large corporations to pay their fair \\nshare.\\nLOWERING COSTS FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE\\nThe President’s top economic priority is lower -\\ning costs for American families.  Thanks to the \\nInflation Reduction Act, the United States is \\nlowering costs for prescription drugs, healthcare, and energy for tens of millions of Americans, in \\na fiscally responsible way.  The Administration’s \\nactions to eliminate junk fees and promote great -\\ner competition across the American economy are 16 INVeSTING IN AMeRICA AND THe AMeRICAN PeOPLe\\nplaying a key role in lowering costs.  The Budget \\nbuilds on this critical work to lower costs and give \\nfamilies more breathing room.  \\nAccelerates Negotiations of Lower Drug \\nPrices and Expands Access to Prescription \\nDrugs.   Thanks to action taken by the \\nAdministration, millions of seniors are saving \\nmoney on their drug costs, and the Administration \\nannounced the first 10 drugs for which prices will \\nbe negotiated as it continues implementation of \\nthe Inflation Reduction Act.  The Budget builds \\non this success by significantly increasing the \\npace of negotiation, bringing more drugs into ne -\\ngotiation sooner after they launch, expanding in -\\nflation rebates and $2,000 out-of-pocket prescrip -\\ntion drug cost cap beyond Medicare and into the \\ncommercial market, and other steps to build on \\nthe Inflation Reduction Act drug provisions.  In \\naddition, the Budget extends the $35 cost-shar -\\ning cap for a month’s supply of a covered insulin \\nproduct to the commercial market.  For Medicaid, \\nthe Budget includes proposals to ensure Medicaid \\nand the Children’s Health Insurance Program \\n(CHIP) are prudent purchasers of prescription \\ndrugs, such as authorizing the Department of \\nHealth and Human Services (HHS) to negotiate \\nsupplemental drug rebates on behalf of interest -\\ned States in order to pool purchasing power.  The \\nBudget also limits Medicare Part D cost-sharing \\nfor high-value generic drugs, such as those used \\nto treat hypertension and hyperlipidemia, to no \\nmore than $2 per month for Medicare beneficia -\\nries.  To speed up development and increase ac -\\ncess to safe and affordable biosimilar medicines, \\nthe Budget streamlines and modernizes the Food \\nand Drug Administration’s (FDA) premarket re -\\nview.  The Budget also includes funding for con -\\ntinued implementation of the No Surprises Act, \\nwhich protects Americans across the Nation from \\nsurprise medical bills.  \\nLowers Child Care Costs.   From the begin -\\nning of this Administration, the President and \\nVice President have been focused on child care \\ncosts as a critical challenge for families.  When \\nchild care is reliable, high-quality, and afford -\\nable, parents can make ends meet, advance in \\ntheir careers, and stay in the workforce—while children benefit from opportunities to socialize \\nwith peers.  The President is committed to pro -\\nviding relief to families, and the Budget creates a \\nhistoric new program under which working fami -\\nlies with incomes up to $200,000 per year would \\nbe guaranteed affordable, high-quality child care \\nfrom birth until kindergarten, with most fami -\\nlies paying no more than $10 a day, and the low -\\nest income families paying nothing.  This would \\nprovide a lifeline to the parents of more than 16 \\nmillion children, saving the average family over \\n$600 per month in care costs, per child, and giv -\\ning parents the freedom to select a high-quality \\nchild care setting.  This investment could help \\nhundreds of thousands of women with young \\nchildren enter or re-enter the workforce more \\nquickly.  The President’s Council of economic \\nAdvisers found that recent Federal investments \\nin child care have increased labor force partici -\\npation among mothers with young children by \\nroughly three percentage points, equivalent to \\nover 300,000 more women in the labor force.  The \\nPresident’s proposal would also ensure that early \\ncare and education workers receive fair and com -\\npetitive pay.  In addition, the Budget provides \\n$8.5\\xa0billion for the Child Care and Development \\nBlock Grant, a 44-percent increase since the first \\nyear of the Administration, which would continue \\nto serve school-age children, while most children \\nunder age six would be served through the new \\nprogram.  The Budget also expands a tax credit \\nto encourage businesses to provide child care ben -\\nefits to their employees.\\nReduces the Cost of Education Pathways \\nthat Connect to Growing Jobs.   ensuring all \\nAmericans benefit from the jobs created by the \\nInvesting in America agenda is critical to grow -\\ning the economy from the middle out and the bot -\\ntom up.  High college prices deter many young \\npeople from attending the colleges that would be \\nbest for them.  The Budget includes a $12\\xa0billion \\nmandatory Reducing the Costs of College Fund \\nthat would fund three strategies to lower college \\ncosts for students.  First, the fund would pro -\\nvide competitive awards for public institutions \\nthat affordably deliver a quality education, al -\\nlowing those schools to use those funds either to \\nserve more students or to share best practices so BUDGeT OF THe U. S. GOVeRNMeNT FOR FISCAL YeAR 2025 17\\nthat other schools can become more affordable.  \\nSecond, the Classroom to Career fund would also \\nprovide over $7\\xa0billion for States to provide access \\nto at least 12 credits of transferable career-con -\\nnected dual enrollment credits to students while \\nin high school—credits that can enable students \\nto obtain postsecondary degrees more affordably.  \\nThird, the fund would support evidence-based \\nstrategies, such as the City University of New \\nYork’s Accelerated Study in Associated Programs \\nAssociate Program model, which increase college \\ngraduation rates, reduce cost burdens for stu -\\ndents, and lower costs per graduate. \\nIncreases Affordable Housing Supply to \\nReduce Housing Costs.   The President believes \\nthat all Americans should be able to afford a qual -\\nity home.  The Budget builds on previous invest -\\nments and actions by this Administration to boost \\nhousing supply and lower housing costs, particu -\\nlarly for lower- and middle-income households.  \\nThe Budget invests $1.3\\xa0 billion in the HOMe \\nInvestment Partnerships Program (HOMe) to \\nconstruct and rehabilitate affordable rental hous -\\ning and provide homeownership opportunities.  To \\nfurther address the critical shortage of affordable \\nhousing in communities throughout the Nation, \\nthe Budget provides $20\\xa0 billion in mandatory \\nfunding for a new Innovation Fund for Housing \\nexpansion, which would be a competitive grant \\nprogram for municipalities and other entities \\nthat develop concrete plans for expanding hous -\\ning supply, with additional funding for housing \\naffordability pilots.  The Budget also provides \\n$7.5\\xa0billion in mandatory funding for new Project-\\nBased Rental Assistance contracts to incentivize \\nthe development of new climate-resilient afford -\\nable housing.  The Budget expands the existing \\nLow-Income Housing Tax Credit and proposes a \\nnew Neighborhood Homes Tax Credit.  Together \\nthese proposals would expand the supply of safe \\nand affordable housing, bring new units to mar -\\nket, and ultimately help curb cost growth across \\nthe broader rental market.  \\nExpands Access to Homeownership and \\nReduces Down Payments for First-Time and \\nFirst-Generation Homebuyers.   The Budget \\nproposes a new Mortgage Relief Credit to help increase access to affordable housing.  The pro -\\nposal includes a new tax credit for middle-class \\nfirst-time homebuyers of up to $10,000 over two \\nyears to ease affordability challenges.  In addi -\\ntion, to unlock starter home inventory for first-\\ntime homebuyers and help middle-class fami -\\nlies who are “locked in” to their current homes \\ndue to lower mortgage rates at the time of pur -\\nchase, this proposal also includes a credit of up \\nto $10,000 for one year to middle-class families \\nwho sell their starter home—a home at or below \\nthe area median home price—to another owner-\\noccupant.  The Budget also provides $10\\xa0billion \\nin mandatory funding for a new First-Generation \\nDown Payment Assistance program to help ad -\\ndress homeownership and wealth gaps.  In addi -\\ntion, the Budget preserves the Administration’s \\nprogress in expanding access to homeownership \\nfor underserved borrowers, including many first-\\ntime and minority homebuyers, through Federal \\nHousing Administration (FHA) and Ginnie Mae \\ncredit guarantees.  In 2023, first-time homebuy -\\ners accounted for over 80 percent of FHA-insured \\nhome purchase loans.  The Budget also includes \\nup to $50\\xa0million for a HOMe down payment as -\\nsistance pilot program that would reduce mort -\\ngage down payments for first-generation as well \\nas low wealth first-time homebuyers. \\nExpands Access to Affordable Rent \\nthrough the Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) \\nProgram.   The HCV program currently provides \\n2.3\\xa0 million low-income families with rental as -\\nsistance to obtain housing in the private market, \\nbut many families who are eligible do not receive \\nassistance due to limited funding.  The Budget \\nproposes $32.8\\xa0 billion in discretionary funding, \\nan increase of $2.5\\xa0 billion over the 2023 level, \\nand assumes Public Housing Agencies will draw \\n$963\\xa0million from HCV program reserves to main -\\ntain and protect critical services for all currently \\nassisted families.  The Budget also reflects the \\nAdministration’s continued commitment to ex -\\npand assistance, supporting an additional 20,000 \\nhouseholds, particularly those who are experienc -\\ning homelessness or fleeing, or attempting to flee, \\ndomestic violence or other forms of gender-based \\nviolence.  To further ensure that more households \\nhave access to safe and affordable housing, the 18 INVeSTING IN AMeRICA AND THe AMeRICAN PeOPLe\\nBudget includes mandatory funding to support \\ntwo populations that are particularly vulnerable \\nto homelessness—youth aging out of foster care \\nand extremely low-income (eLI) veterans.  The \\nBudget provides $9\\xa0billion to establish a housing \\nvoucher program for all 20,000 youth aging out \\nof foster care annually, and provides $13\\xa0billion \\nto incrementally expand rental assistance for \\n400,000 eLI veteran families, paving a path to \\nguaranteed assistance for all who have served \\nthe Nation and are in need.  Since the beginning \\nof this Administration, Department of Housing \\nand Urban Development (HUD) has expanded \\nvoucher assistance to over 100,000 additional \\nfamilies, and the Budget continues this progress \\nby expanding voucher access to hundreds of thou -\\nsands of families.\\nReduces Home Heating and Water Costs.   \\nThe Budget provides $4.1\\xa0 billion for the Low \\nIncome Home energy Assistance Program \\n(LIHeAP).  Reducing household energy and \\nwater costs continues to be a priority for the \\nAdministration, as reflected in the $7\\xa0 billion in \\nadditional funding the Administration has se -\\ncured for LIHeAP since 2021.  LIHeAP helps \\nfamilies access home energy and weatherization \\nassistance—vital tools for protecting vulnerable \\nfamilies’ health in response to extreme weather \\nand climate change.  In addition, since the Low \\nIncome Household Water Assistance Program ex -\\npired at the end of 2023, the Budget proposes to \\nallow States the option to use a portion of their \\nLIHeAP funds to provide water bill assistance to \\nlow-income households.\\nLowers Energy Costs and Catalyzes \\nClean Energy and Economic Growth in \\nRural Communities.  The Budget builds on \\nthe $13\\xa0 billion provided in the President’s his -\\ntoric Inflation Reduction Act for rural develop -\\nment programs at the Department of Agriculture \\n(USDA) to reduce energy bills for families, expand \\nclean energy, transform rural power production, \\nand create thousands of good-paying jobs for peo -\\nple across rural America.  Rural communities are \\ncritical to achieving the goal of 100 percent clean \\nelectricity by 2035.  The Budget provides $1\\xa0billion \\nfor loan guarantees for renewable energy systems and energy efficiency improvements for farmers \\nand rural small businesses, and $6.5\\xa0 billion in \\nauthority for rural electric loans to support addi -\\ntional clean energy, energy storage, and transmis -\\nsion projects that would create good-paying jobs.  \\nIn addition, the Budget includes $53\\xa0 million in \\nzero-interest loans for the Rural energy Savings \\nProgram, which would help rural Americans im -\\nplement durable cost-effective energy efficiency \\nmeasures in their homes, which lowers energy \\ncosts and contributes to the President’s clean en -\\nergy goals.  The Budget also provides $10\\xa0million \\nin Rural Community Facilities Grants specifically \\nfor rural communities making an energy transi -\\ntion away from outdated energy sources, facilitat -\\ning emerging infrastructure needs.\\nConnects More Americans to Affordable, \\nHigh-Speed, and Reliable Internet.  The \\nPresident is committed to ensuring that every \\nAmerican has access to affordable broadband in -\\nternet.  Thanks to the Bipartisan Infrastructure \\nLaw:  the Affordable Connectivity Program has \\nprovided high-speed Internet service to over \\n23\\xa0 million eligible low income households at \\nlow or no cost; the Department of Commerce \\n(Commerce) has allocated nearly $42\\xa0 billion \\nin Broadband equity, Access, and Deployment \\nprogram funding to all 50 States, the District \\nof Columbia, and five Territories to deploy reli -\\nable high-speed Internet service; and USDA has \\nprovided $2.3\\xa0billion to people living and work -\\ning across 35 States and Territories, which is ex -\\npected to expand broadband access to more than \\n137,000 households.  Installing high-speed inter -\\nnet creates high-paying union jobs and strength -\\nens local economies, which leads to increased job \\nand population growth, lower unemployment \\nrates, and new business formation.  Reliable in -\\nternet is also crucial for Americans to access \\nhealthcare services through telehealth.  Building \\non the $2\\xa0billion for USDA broadband programs \\nprovided in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law \\nfor 2023, the Budget provides $112\\xa0 million for \\nthe ReConnect program, which provides grants \\nand loans to deploy broadband to unserved areas, \\nespecially tribal areas.  Building on the demon -\\nstrated successes enabled by the $14\\xa0billion pro -\\nvided in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the BUDGeT OF THe U. S. GOVeRNMeNT FOR FISCAL YeAR 2025 19\\nBudget includes the Administration’s pending \\nsupplemental request for $6\\xa0 billion to continue \\nthe Affordable Connectivity Program in 2024 and \\nthe Administration will work with the Congress \\nto secure additional funding for this important \\nneed in 2025 and beyond.\\nEliminates the Origination Fee on Student \\nLoans.   The Budget builds on the President’s \\nhistoric actions to reduce student debt and the \\ncost of college by eliminating the origination fees \\ncharged to borrowers on every new Federal stu -\\ndent loan.  These unnecessary fees burden anyone who needs to borrow to help get an education and \\ncost American families billions of dollars.\\nBolsters Antitrust Enforcement.   The \\nBudget proposes $288\\xa0 million for the Antitrust \\nDivision of the Department of Justice (DOJ), an \\nincrease of $63\\xa0million over the 2023 enacted lev -\\nel and $103\\xa0million over the 2021 enacted level, \\nto strengthen antitrust enforcement efforts to \\npromote vigorous marketplace competition and \\nreduce costs and raise wages for the American \\npeople.\\nSTRENGTHENING AMERICANS’ RETIREMENT SECURITY BY \\nHONORING THE PROMISE OF MEDICARE AND SOCIAL SECURITY\\nPrior to the creation of Social Security nearly \\n90 years ago, almost half of all American seniors \\nlived in poverty—including some seniors who \\nhad worked their entire lives.  Before Medicare \\nwas signed into law almost 60 years ago, many \\nseniors’ basic needs went unmet without health -\\ncare to count on.  Social Security and Medicare \\nare more than Government programs, they are a \\npromise—a rock-solid guarantee that generations \\nof Americans have counted on—that after a life of \\nhard work, you will be able to retire with dignity \\nand security.  As the President has made clear, \\nhe will reject any efforts to cut or undermine the \\nMedicare or Social Security benefits that seniors \\nand people with disabilities have earned and paid \\ninto their entire working lives.  The Budget hon -\\nors that ironclad commitment by firmly opposing \\nbenefit cuts to either program and by embrac -\\ning reforms that would protect and strengthen \\nthese programs.  The President remains com -\\nmitted to working with the Congress to protect \\nMedicare and Social Security for this and future \\ngenerations.\\nStrengthens Medicare by Requiring High-\\nIncome Americans to Contribute Their Fair \\nShare and Reducing Prescription Drug \\nCosts.   The Budget extends solvency of the \\nMedicare Hospital Insurance (HI) trust fund in -\\ndefinitely by modestly increasing the Medicare tax rate on incomes above $400,000, closing loop -\\nholes in existing Medicare taxes, and directing \\nrevenue from the Net Investment Income Tax \\ninto the HI trust fund as was originally intend -\\ned.  Current law allows certain wealthy business \\nowners avoid Medicare taxes on some of the prof -\\nits they get from passthrough businesses.  The \\nBudget closes the loophole that allows certain \\nbusiness owners to avoid paying Medicare taxes \\non these profits and raises Medicare tax rates on \\nearned and unearned income from 3.8 percent to \\n5 percent for those with incomes over $400,000.  \\nIn addition, the Budget directs an amount equiv -\\nalent to the savings from the proposed Medicare \\ndrug reforms into the HI trust fund. \\nProtects the Social Security Benefits that \\nAmericans Have Earned.   The Administration \\nis committed to protecting and strengthening \\nSocial Security.  In particular, the Administration \\nlooks forward to working with the Congress to re -\\nsponsibly strengthen Social Security based on the \\nfollowing principles: \\n• No benefit cuts .  The President opposes \\npolicies that cut benefits, as well as pro -\\nposals to privatize Social Security. \\n• extending solvency by asking the highest-\\nincome Americans to pay their fair share .  20 INVeSTING IN AMeRICA AND THe AMeRICAN PeOPLe\\nThe President believes that protecting \\nSocial Security should start with asking \\nthe highest-income Americans to pay their \\nfair share. \\n• Improving financial security for seniors \\nand people with disabilities .  The President \\nsupports efforts to improve Social Security \\nbenefits, as well as Supplemental Security \\nIncome benefits, for seniors and people \\nwith disabilities, especially for those who \\nface the greatest challenges making ends \\nmeet. \\n• ensuring that Americans can access the \\nbenefits they have earned .  The President \\nsupports investments in Social Security \\nAdministration (SSA) services so that \\nseniors and people with disabilities can \\naccess the benefits they have earned.\\nConsistent with the final principle, the Budget \\ninvests in staff, information technology (IT), \\nand other improvements at SSA, providing an \\nincrease of $1.3\\xa0 billion, a nine-percent increase \\nfrom the 2023 enacted level.  These funds would \\nimprove customer service at SSA’s field offices, \\nState disability determination services, and tele -\\nservice centers for retirees, individuals with dis -\\nabilities, and their families.  The Budget also \\nadds staff to process more disability claims and reduce the amount of time claimants have to wait \\nfor decisions on vital benefits. \\nProtects Seniors’ Health and Dignity.   \\nThe Budget invests $150\\xa0 billion over 10 years \\nto strengthen and expand Medicaid home and \\ncommunity-based services, allowing elderly and \\nindividuals with disabilities to remain in their \\nhomes and stay active in their communities, and \\nimproving the quality of jobs for home care work -\\ners.  The Budget also increases funding for senior \\nnutrition services to ensure seniors continue to \\nreceive healthy meals by eight percent above the \\n2023 level, and 21 percent over the 2021 level.  In \\naddition, the Budget proposes to shift funding for \\nnursing home surveys from discretionary to man -\\ndatory beginning in 2026, and increase funding \\nto cover 100 percent of statutorily-mandated sur -\\nveys, which would guard against negligent care \\nand ensure that Americans receive high-quality, \\nsafe services within these facilities.  The Budget \\nalso continues to build on the President’s commit -\\nment to protect the Nation’s seniors through a \\ncomprehensive agenda that:  improves the safety \\nand quality of nursing home care; addresses the \\nbacklog of complaint surveys from nursing home \\nresidents; expands financial penalties for under -\\nperforming facilities; requires greater transpar -\\nency of nursing facility ownership; and increases \\nthe inspection of facilities with serious safety \\ndeficiencies.\\nPROTECTING AND EXPANDING ACCESS TO HIGH-QUALITY \\nHEALTHCARE AND CREATING HEALTHIER COMMUNITIES\\nThe Administration has achieved monumental \\ngains in its commitment to protect and expand \\nAmericans’ access to quality, affordable health -\\ncare.  Since taking office, the President has:  deliv -\\nered the resources necessary to end the COVID-19 \\nemergency; built on the success of the Affordable \\nCare Act to further close the uninsured gap; re -\\nduced Americans’ healthcare premiums and pre -\\nscription drug costs; finally allowed Medicare \\nto negotiate for lower prescription drug prices; \\nacted to protect millions of consumers from sur -\\nprise medical bills and junk fees; made progress on bold new goals as part of the Biden Cancer \\nMoonshot; and created new efforts dedicated to \\npreventing, detecting, and treating devastating \\ndiseases like cancer and Alzheimer’s disease.  The \\nAdministration recognizes that by investing in \\nthe health and well-being of the American people, \\nhealthier, safer, and more productive communities \\ncan be created.  The Budget protects the progress \\nthis Administration has made while proposing \\nadditional investments to address the challenges \\nthat remain, including further expanding access \\nto high-quality healthcare, responding to mental BUDGeT OF THe U. S. GOVeRNMeNT FOR FISCAL YeAR 2025 21\\nhealth needs, and strengthening America’s public \\nhealth infrastructure. \\nPutting High-Quality \\nHealthcare Within Reach\\nExpands Access to Quality, Affordable \\nHealthcare.   The President and the Vice \\nPresident believe that healthcare is a right, not a \\nprivilege.  With enrollment in marketplace cover -\\nage at an all-time high, the Budget builds on the \\nincredible success of the Affordable Care Act by \\nmaking permanent the expanded premium tax \\ncredits that the Inflation Reduction Act extended \\nand providing Medicaid-like coverage to individ -\\nuals in States that have not adopted Medicaid \\nexpansion, paired with financial incentives to \\nensure States maintain their existing expan -\\nsions.  For Medicaid and CHIP, the Budget allows \\nStates to extend the existing 12-month continu -\\nous eligibility for all children to 36 months, and \\nallows States to provide continuous eligibil -\\nity for children from birth until they turn age \\nsix.  Further, the Budget prohibits enrollment \\nfees and premiums in CHIP.  The President also \\nsupports eliminating Medicaid funding caps for \\nPuerto Rico and other Territories while aligning \\ntheir matching rate with States—and moving to -\\nward parity for other critical Federal programs \\nincluding Supplemental Security Income and the \\nSupplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.\\nSupports Family Planning Services for \\nMore Americans.   Americans deserve access to \\nthe healthcare they need, including contraception \\nand family planning services, which are essential \\nto ensuring control over personal decisions about \\ntheir own health, lives, and families.  For more \\nthan 50 years, Title X family planning clinics \\nhave played a critical role in ensuring access to a \\nbroad range of high-quality family planning and \\npreventive health services.  Most Title X clients \\nlive in poverty and the uninsured rate of Title X \\nusers is twice the national average, making the \\nTitle X family planning program a critical part \\nof the public health safety net.  The Budget in -\\ncludes $390\\xa0million, a 36-percent increase above \\nthe 2023 enacted level, for the Title X Family Planning program to increase the number of pa -\\ntients served to 3.6 million.\\nPromotes Maternal Health and Health \\nEquity.   The United States has the highest ma -\\nternal mortality rate among developed nations, \\nand rates are disproportionately high for Black, \\nAmerican Indian, Alaska Native, and rural \\nwomen.  Since 2021, funding to reduce maternal \\nmortality has grown by over $190\\xa0million, dem -\\nonstrating the Administration’s commitment to \\naddressing needs in this area.  The Budget con -\\ntinues this progress by including $376\\xa0million, an \\nincrease of $82\\xa0 million above the 2023 enacted \\nlevel to support the ongoing implementation of \\nthe White House Blueprint for Addressing the \\nMaternal Health Crisis , launched by the Vice \\nPresident, to reduce maternal mortality and \\nmorbidity rates, and address the highest rates \\nof perinatal health disparities.  The Budget ex -\\npands Medicaid maternal health support services \\nduring the pregnancy and post-partum period by \\nincentivizing States to reimburse a broad range \\nof providers including doulas, community health \\nworkers, peer support initiatives, and nurse \\nhome visiting programs.  In addition, the Budget \\nbuilds on the success of the more than 40 States \\nthat answered the Vice President’s call to extend \\nMedicaid postpartum coverage for 12 months, \\neliminating gaps in health insurance at a critical \\ntime for all women. \\nSaving Lives by Advancing \\nBehavioral Healthcare\\nStrengthens Mental Health Parity \\nProtections.   The Budget requires all health \\nplans to cover mental health and substance use \\ndisorder benefits, ensures that plans have an ad -\\nequate network of behavioral health providers, \\nand improves the Department of Labor’s (DOL) \\nability to enforce the law.  In addition, the Budget \\nincludes $275\\xa0 million over 10 years to increase \\nthe Department’s capacity to ensure that large \\ngroup market health plans and issuers comply \\nwith mental health and substance use disorder \\nrequirements, and to take action against plans \\nand issuers that do not comply.22 INVeSTING IN AMeRICA AND THe AMeRICAN PeOPLe\\nExpands Coverage and Invests in \\nBehavioral Healthcare Services.   In 2022, \\nalmost a quarter of adults suffered from men -\\ntal illness, 13 percent of adolescents had serious \\nthoughts of suicide, and overdose deaths con -\\ntinued near record highs.  As a core pillar of his \\nUnity Agenda, the President released a national \\nstrategy to transform how to understand and ad -\\ndress mental health in America—and the Budget \\nmakes progress on this agenda by improving \\naccess to care for individuals and communities.  \\nThe Budget makes significant investments in ex -\\npanding the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline that \\nis projected to respond to 7.5\\xa0 million contacts \\nfrom individuals in distress in 2025 alone.  The \\nBudget:  expands mental healthcare and sup -\\nport services in schools; expands the Centers \\nfor Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) sui -\\ncide prevention program to additional States, as \\nwell as tribal and territorial jurisdictions; and \\ninvests in strengthening the behavioral health \\nworkforce—including integration of behavioral \\nhealth services into primary care settings.  The \\nBudget also expands access to behavioral health \\nservices through significant investments in \\nCertified Community Behavioral Health Clinics \\nand Community Mental Health Centers.  In ad -\\ndition, the Budget\\xa0provides $1\\xa0billion to advance \\nHealth IT adoption and engagement in interop -\\nerability for certain behavioral health providers.  \\nThe Administration is also implementing the \\nBipartisan Safer Communities Act—the single \\nlargest investment to support student mental \\nhealth in history, which would help hire and train \\nover 14,000 school-based mental health profes -\\nsionals across the Nation. \\nExpands Access to Treatment for \\nSubstance Use Disorder.\\xa0 The Administration \\nhas made historic advances in expanding access \\nto treatment for opioid use disorder, including \\nsigning into law a bipartisan provision to ex -\\npand the number of medical providers who can \\ninitiate buprenorphine treatment for opioid use \\ndisorder from 129,000 to nearly two million, a \\n15-fold increase that can expand treatment to ru -\\nral and underserved areas.  Funding for States, \\nTerritories, and Tribes through the Substance Use Prevention, Treatment, and Recovery Services \\nBlock Grant and the State Opioid Response \\ngrant program has grown by a combined seven \\npercent since 2021, expanding access to preven -\\ntion, harm reduction, treatment, and recovery \\nsupport services nationwide.\\xa0 The Budget builds \\non these accomplishments by increasing funding \\nfor the State Opioid Response grant program, \\nwhich has provided treatment services to over \\n1.2 million people and enabled States to reverse \\nmore than 500,000 overdoses with over nine \\nmillion purchased overdose reversal medication \\nkits.  The Budget also invests in a new technical \\nassistance center to strengthen health providers’ \\nunderstanding and treatment of women’s mental \\nhealth and substance use.\\nDriving Healthcare Innovation and \\nDiscovering Future Treatments \\nAdvances Progress toward Biden Cancer \\nMoonshot Goals.   The President and First Lady \\nreignited the Biden Cancer Moonshot to mobilize \\na national effort to end cancer as we know it—\\nspurring tremendous action across the Federal \\nGovernment and from the public and private \\nsectors, and building a strong foundation for the \\nwork ahead.  To date, the Biden Cancer Moonshot \\nhas announced roughly 50 new programs, poli -\\ncies, and resources to address five priority actions \\nincluding:  improving access to cancer screening; \\nunderstanding and addressing environmental \\nand toxic exposures; making progress on cancer \\nprevention; driving innovation to reach commu -\\nnities and individuals; and boosting support for \\npatients, families, and caregivers.  More than 100 \\nprivate companies, non-profits, academic institu -\\ntions, and patient groups have also stepped up \\nwith new actions and collaborations.  The Budget \\nmakes significant investments to work toward \\nthe President and First Lady’s signature Biden \\nCancer Moonshot goal of reducing the cancer \\ndeath rate by at least 50 percent over the next \\n25 years and improving the experience of people \\nwho are living with or who have survived can -\\ncer.  These investments include an increase of \\nmore than $2\\xa0billion across the National Cancer BUDGeT OF THe U. S.

Over the past three years, sub -\\nstantial progress has been made toward develop -\\ning and implementing transformational capabili -\\nties to increase the Nation’s ability to respond \\nto and prepare for emerging health threats.  \\nBuilding upon this progress, the Budget invests \\n$9.8\\xa0 billion in both discretionary and manda -\\ntory Prevention and Public Health Fund fund -\\ning, an increase of $499\\xa0 million over the 2023 \\nenacted level, to bolster public health capacity \\nto enable CDC to better serve and protect the \\nAmerican public.  These resources would contin -\\nue to strengthen State, tribal, local, and territo -\\nrial health departments, enhance public health \\ndata systems and collection, and improve the core \\nimmunization program.  In addition, the Budget \\nincludes $20\\xa0 billion in mandatory funding for \\nHHS public health agencies in support of the \\nAdministration’s biodefense priorities as outlined \\nin the 2022 National Biodefense Strategy and \\nImplementation Plan for Countering Biological \\nThreats, Enhancing Pandemic Preparedness, and \\nAchieving Global Health Security .Invests in the Treatment and Prevention \\nof Infectious Diseases.   The Budget invests in \\nthe treatment and prevention of infectious dis -\\neases, including Hepatitis C, HIV, and vaccine-\\npreventable diseases.  The Budget proposes a na -\\ntional program to significantly expand screening, \\ntesting, treatment, prevention, and monitoring of \\nHepatitis C infections in the United States, with \\na specific focus on populations with high infection \\nlevels.  To help end the HIV epidemic, the Budget \\neliminates barriers to accessing pre-exposure \\nprophylaxis—also known as PreP—for Medicaid \\nbeneficiaries and proposes a new mandatory pro -\\ngram to guarantee PreP at no cost for all unin -\\nsured and underinsured individuals and provide \\nessential wrap-around services.  The Budget also \\ninvests in State and local efforts to promote eq -\\nuity and protect civil rights through a new ini -\\ntiative to modernize outdated criminal statutes \\nwith a discriminatory impact on HIV-positive \\nindividuals.  In addition, the Budget proposes a \\nnew Vaccines for Adults program to provide unin -\\nsured adults with access to routine and outbreak \\nvaccines at no cost.  The Budget also expands the \\nVaccines for Children (VFC) program to include \\nall children under age 19 enrolled in CHIP and \\ncovers the vaccine administration fee for all VFC-\\neligible uninsured children. \\nSUPPORTING AMERICA’S WORKFORCE AND PREPARING AMERICA’S \\nECONOMY FOR 21ST CENTURY CHALLENGES\\nThe President’s economic strategy is rooted \\nin what has always worked best for this Nation:  \\ninvesting in America and the American people.  \\nSince the President took office, the economy has \\nadded about 15 million new jobs—including near -\\nly 800,000 manufacturing jobs—more Americans \\nare working than at any point in American his -\\ntory, a record number of Americans have started \\nsmall businesses, and America continues to out -\\npace its global peers in the speed and breadth of \\nour economic recovery from the COVID-19 pan -\\ndemic.  The President’s plan is modernizing and \\nrebuilding America’s infrastructure, promoting a flexible and dynamic workforce, empowering \\nworkers and creating good jobs here at home, \\nfueling healthy competition in the marketplace, \\nand reinvigorating manufacturing and industry \\nacross the Nation.  The Budget builds on this \\nproven record of economic success with addition -\\nal proposals to secure America’s position as the \\nstrongest economy in the world by:  continuing \\nto invest in manufacturing and making more in \\nAmerica; ensuring workers and entrepreneurs \\nhave the skills and supports to thrive; and creat -\\ning good-paying jobs in emerging fields.24 INVeSTING IN AMeRICA AND THe AMeRICAN PeOPLe\\nBoosting American Manufacturing \\nand Investing in Infrastructure\\nContinues Implementation of the \\nPresident’s Historic Bipartisan Infrastructure  \\nLaw.   The Budget provides a total of $78.4\\xa0billion \\nfor highway, highway safety, and transit formula \\nprograms, supporting the amounts authorized for \\nyear four of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.  \\nThis includes $62.1\\xa0billion in obligation limitation \\nfunding for the Federal-aid Highways program, \\nan increase of $3.3\\xa0billion above the 2023 enacted \\nlevel and $15.7\\xa0billion above the enacted level for \\n2021, the year prior to enactment of the Bipartisan \\nInfrastructure Law.  This funding would sup -\\nport the continued repair and upgrading of the \\nNation’s highways and bridges.  The Budget also \\nincludes $14.3\\xa0billion for Transit Formula Grants, \\na $645\\xa0million increase above the 2023\\xa0enacted \\nlevel, to support core capital and planning pro -\\ngrams for transit agencies across the Nation, as \\nwell as transit research, technical assistance, and \\ndata collection.  The Budget also reflects an addi -\\ntional $9.5\\xa0billion in advance appropriations pro -\\nvided by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law for \\nbridge replacement and rehabilitation, electric \\nvehicle charging infrastructure, and other pro -\\ngrams to improve the safety, sustainability, and \\nresilience of America’s transportation network. \\nMaintains World Leading Research \\nthrough the CHIPS and Science Act \\nInvestments.   The Budget invests $20\\xa0 billion \\nacross major research agencies, an increase \\nof $1.2\\xa0 billion above the 2023 level, to boost \\nAmerican innovation and re-establish American \\nleadership in research and scientific discovery.  \\nAt the National Science Foundation (NSF), these \\ninvestments include support for regional inno -\\nvation programs, investments in emerging tech -\\nnologies—such as artificial intelligence (AI) and \\nquantum information science—and science, tech -\\nnology, engineering, and mathematics (STeM) \\nworkforce programs.  Funding for Commerce’s \\nNational Institute for Standards and Technology \\nwould support activities responsive to the \\nAdministration’s executive Order 14110, “Safe, \\nSecure and Trustworthy Development and Use of \\nArtificial Intelligence” and fund construction and maintenance of research and development facili -\\nties.  In the Department of energy’s (DOe) Office \\nof Science, the Budget supports AI, high perfor -\\nmance computing to improve climate modeling, \\nclean energy technologies including fusion, and \\npositions the United States to meet the demand \\nfor isotopes.\\nPrioritizes Investment in the Federal \\nAviation Administration (FAA).   The Budget \\nprovides $17.5\\xa0billion in discretionary budget au -\\nthority for FAA, an increase of $2.1\\xa0billion above \\nthe 2023 enacted level, less Congressionally \\nDirected Spending.  This funding supports robust \\nhiring and training of air traffic controllers start -\\ned in 2023, to rebuild the pipeline of new control -\\nlers needed to safely meet projected air traffic \\ndemands.  The Budget also continues FAA’s mul -\\ntiyear effort of reforming aircraft certification, as \\nwell as increasing its safety oversight capabili -\\nties.  The Budget proposes a five-year, $8\\xa0billion \\nmandatory program to significantly modernize \\nFAA’s major facilities and radars.  This effort \\nwould ensure that the American people and all \\ntravelers can continue to depend on a safe, mod -\\nern, and efficient aviation system.  In addition, \\nthe Administration proposes to increase the fuel \\ntax for high-end business jets, to better align the \\ncosts of the services provided to those users on \\nthe system.\\nBuilds on Investments for a Safe and \\nEfficient Passenger and Freight Rail \\nNetwork.   The Budget expands on the \\nBipartisan Infrastructure Law’s already signifi -\\ncant investments toward improving the safety \\nand efficiency of the Nation’s rail network.  This \\nincludes $2.5\\xa0billion for grants to Amtrak, along \\nwith $250\\xa0 million for the Consolidated Rail \\nInfrastructure and Safety Improvements pro -\\ngram, which is in addition to the $13.2\\xa0billion in \\nrail funding directly provided by the Bipartisan \\nInfrastructure Law.  The Budget also increases \\nfunding for critical rail safety programs. \\nSupports the Administration’s Goal of \\nReplacing All Lead Pipes and Invests in \\nCritical Water Infrastructure.   To help pro -\\ntect families from the health hazards of lead BUDGeT OF THe U. S. GOVeRNMeNT FOR FISCAL YeAR 2025 25\\npipes, the Budget provides a total of $101\\xa0million \\nto two environmental Protection Agency (ePA) \\ngrant programs dedicated to remediating lead \\ncontamination in drinking water—the Reducing \\nLead in Drinking Water grant program and the \\nVoluntary School and Child Care Lead Testing \\nand Reduction Grant Program—an increase of \\n$53\\xa0million over the 2021 enacted level.  This in -\\nvestment, along with other programs at ePA that \\ncan be used for lead projects, builds on the his -\\ntoric $15\\xa0billion in direct funding for lead pipe re -\\nplacement through the Bipartisan Infrastructure \\nLaw and underscores the President’s commit -\\nment to ensuring access to safe drinking water \\nand creating good-paying jobs in the process.  In \\naddition, the Budget provides a total of $2.4\\xa0bil -\\nlion for ePA’s State Revolving Funds for drink -\\ning water and wastewater infrastructure, an \\nincrease of more than $1\\xa0billion over the 2023 en -\\nacted level for those programs.  The Budget also \\nprovides $350\\xa0million in HUD grants for States, \\nlocal governments, and nonprofits to reduce lead-\\nbased paint and other health hazards, especially \\nin the homes of low-income families with young \\nchildren.  The Budget targets $67\\xa0million at HUD \\nspecifically to prevent and mitigate lead-based \\npaint and housing-related health hazards, such \\nas fire safety and mold, in public housing, an in -\\ncrease of $2\\xa0million above 2023 levels.\\nStrengthens American Leadership in \\nSpace.   The Budget includes $7.8\\xa0 billion for \\nthe Artemis program, which would bring astro -\\nnauts—including the first women, first people of \\ncolor, and first international astronauts—to the \\nlunar surface as part of a long-term journey of \\nscience and exploration.  The Budget invests in \\nnew systems to assist lunar surface science and \\nexploration activities, including a small lunar \\nrover and a large cargo lander that would be used \\nto deliver larger rovers and habitats to the sur -\\nface in the 2030s.\\nSupporting Workers, Entrepreneurs, \\nand Small Businesses\\nCuts Taxes for Families with Children and \\nAmerican Workers.   The Budget would expand key tax cuts benefitting lower- and middle-income \\nworkers and families.  The Budget would restore \\nthe full Child Tax Credit enacted in the American \\nRescue Plan, which helped cut child poverty \\nnearly in half in 2021 to its lowest level in his -\\ntory.  The Budget would expand the credit from \\n$2,000 per child to $3,000 per child for children \\nsix years old and above, and to $3,600 per child \\nfor children under six.  In addition, the Budget \\nwould permanently reform the credit to make \\nit fully refundable, so that it no longer excludes \\n18 million children in the lowest-income families \\nfrom receiving the full credit, and allow fami -\\nlies to receive monthly advance payments.  The \\nPresident also calls on the Congress to make per -\\nmanent the earned Income Tax Credit expansion \\nfor workers not raising children in their homes, \\nwhich would boost the income of 19 million very \\nlow-paid workers.\\nProvides National, Comprehensive Paid \\nFamily and Medical Leave and Proposes \\nPaid Sick Days. \\xa0 The vast majority of America’s \\nworkers do not have access to employer-provided \\npaid family leave, including 73 percent of private \\nsector workers.  Among the lowest-paid workers, \\nwho are disproportionately women and work -\\ners of color, 94 percent lack access to paid fam -\\nily leave through their employers.  In addition, \\nas many as one in five retirees leave the work -\\nforce earlier than planned to care for an ill fam -\\nily member, which negatively impacts families, as \\nwell as the Nation’s labor supply and productiv -\\nity.  The Budget proposes to establish a national, \\ncomprehensive paid family and medical leave \\nprogram administered by SSA to ensure that all \\neligible workers can take up to 12 weeks to bond \\nwith a new child, care for a seriously ill loved one, \\nheal from their own serious illness, address cir -\\ncumstances arising from a loved one’s military \\ndeployment, find safety from domestic violence, \\ndating violence, sexual assault, or stalking—oth -\\nerwise known as “safe leave”; or up to three days \\nto grieve the death of a loved one.\\xa0The program \\nwould provide workers with progressive, partial \\nwage replacement to take time off for family and \\nmedical reasons; include robust administrative \\nfunding; and use an inclusive family definition.  \\nFurther, the President continues to call on the 26 INVeSTING IN AMeRICA AND THe AMeRICAN PeOPLe\\nCongress to require employers to provide seven \\njob-protected paid sick days each year to all work -\\ners, and ensure that employers cannot penalize \\nworkers for taking time off to address their health \\nneeds, or the health needs of their families, or for \\nsafe leave.\\nEmpowers and Protects Workers.   Workers \\npower America’s economic prosperity, building \\nthe economy from the middle out and bottom \\nup.  To ensure workers are treated with dignity \\nand respect in the workplace, the Budget invests \\n$2\\xa0 billion in DOL’s worker protection agencies.  \\nThese investments would build upon the near -\\nly $100\\xa0 million increase in base appropriations \\nfor these agencies since the beginning of the \\nAdministration, in addition to the $200\\xa0million in \\nAmerican Rescue Plan funding the Administration \\nsecured for the agencies to address the unprec -\\nedented COVID-19 emergency.  The Budget \\nwould enable DOL to protect workers’ wages and \\nbenefits, ensure that children are working only \\nin conditions that are safe and legal, address \\nthe misclassification of workers as independent \\ncontractors, and improve workplace health and \\nsafety.  Since 2019, DOL has seen an 88-percent \\nincrease in children being employed illegally by \\ncompanies.  The Administration is focused on pre -\\nventing and addressing child labor exploitation, \\nand has assessed more than $16\\xa0million in child \\nlabor penalties.  The Budget also includes addi -\\ntional funding to combat exploitative child labor, \\nincluding among migrant children, who are par -\\nticularly vulnerable.  For the equal employment \\nOpportunity Commission, the Budget supports \\nimplementation and enforcement of the Pregnant \\nWorkers Fairness Act, and advancement of pay \\nequity through the collection and analysis of em -\\nployer pay data.  The Budget also supports the \\nAgency’s work to ensure that employers’ use of \\nautomated employment systems, including those \\nthat incorporate AI, does not result in discrimi -\\nnation against employees or job applicants in \\nany of a wide range of job-related activities, in -\\ncluding recruitment, selection, retention, pay, or \\npromotion.  The Budget also includes funding to \\nstrengthen the National Labor Relations Board’s \\ncapacity to enforce workers’ right to organize and \\ncollectively bargain for better wages and working conditions.  The Budget proposes instituting and \\nsignificantly increasing penalties for employers \\nthat violate workplace safety and health, wage \\nand hour, child labor, equal opportunity, and labor \\norganizing rules.  The Budget also includes fund -\\ning to implement the significant reforms to em -\\nployer-sponsored retirement plans enacted in the \\nSeCURe 2.0 Act of 2022, helping to ensure that \\nworkers’ retirement plans are always protected. \\nBroadens Access to Registered \\nApprenticeships.   The Budget increases sup -\\nport for Registered Apprenticeships, an evidence-\\nbased earn-and-learn model that is a critical tool \\nfor training future workforces for good jobs in the \\nclean energy, construction, semiconductor, trans -\\nportation and logistics, education, health, and \\nother growing and in-demand industries.  The \\nBudget invests $335\\xa0 million, a $50\\xa0 million in -\\ncrease above the 2023 enacted level, and supports \\nexpanding existing Registered Apprenticeship \\nprograms in clean energy-related occupations.  \\nThis investment would also be used to increase \\nthe number of workers from historically under -\\nrepresented groups, including people of color, \\nwomen, and people with disabilities, who partici -\\npate in Registered Apprenticeships. \\nExpands Access to Capital for Small \\nBusinesses.   Building on the historic growth in \\nsmall business applications under the President \\nand Vice President’s leadership, the Budget sup -\\nports historic lending levels across the Small \\nBusiness Administration’s (SBA) business lend -\\ning programs, including:  the 7(a) business loan \\nguarantee; capital for major fixed assets, other -\\nwise known as a 504 loan guarantee; the Small \\nBusiness Investment Company (SBIC) program; \\nand Microloan programs.  The over $58\\xa0billion in \\nlending provided in the Budget would address \\nthe need for greater access to affordable capital, \\nparticularly in underserved communities.  The \\nBudget proposes a new direct 7(a) lending pro -\\ngram, which would further enable SBA to ad -\\ndress gaps in access to small dollar lending.  In \\naddition, increasing the authorized lending level \\nfor the SBIC program by 16 percent to $7\\xa0billion \\nwould significantly expand the availability of \\nventure capital funding for small businesses.BUDGeT OF THe U.

The Budget also provides \\nfunding to assist farmers, ranchers, and forest -\\nland owners with production goals in the face of a \\nchanging climate while conserving, maintaining, \\nand restoring natural resources on their lands.  \\nOverall, the Budget supports enhanced and coor -\\ndinated provision of climate information and tools \\nto support decision making across the Nation.\\nInvests in America’s Brave Wildland \\nFirefighters. \\xa0  The Budget builds on the \\nAdministration’s historic investments in the \\nwildland firefighting workforce at USDA and \\nDOI by supporting the implementation of per -\\nmanent and comprehensive pay reform, the en -\\nhancement of health services, the hiring of ad -\\nditional permanent and temporary wildland \\nfirefighters to increase capacity, and the improve -\\nment of Government housing.  These invest -\\nments, totaling $522\\xa0million over the comparable 2023 enacted funding levels, would help address \\nlong-standing recruitment and retention chal -\\nlenges, increase the Departments’ capacity to \\ncomplete critical risk mitigation work, and fur -\\nther the Administration’s commitment to build \\na more robust and resilient wildland firefighting \\nworkforce as the frequency and intensity of cata -\\nstrophic wildfires continue to increase due to cli -\\nmate change. \\nIncreases Drought Resilience. \\xa0 The Budget \\nhelps ensure communities across the West have \\naccess to a resilient and reliable water supply \\nby investing in rural water projects, water con -\\nservation, development of desalination technolo -\\ngies, and water recycling and reuse projects.  The \\nBudget complements the nearly $1.7\\xa0billion pro -\\nvided in 2025 for western water infrastructure \\nthrough the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, as \\nwell as the nearly $4.6\\xa0 billion provided by the \\nInflation Reduction Act for drought mitigation \\nand domestic water supply projects through the \\nBureau of Reclamation.\\xa0 \\nReduces Housing Insecurity and \\nStrengthens Climate Resiliency in Rural \\nCommunities.  Adequate affordable housing \\nhas been a long-standing problem in rural com -\\nmunities—one that is exacerbated by low energy \\nefficiency of the aging housing stock, meaning \\nhigher costs to families.  To help address this, the \\nBudget proposes additional funding for USDA \\nmultifamily and single-family housing, and again \\nproposes to eliminate the existing low-income \\nborrower penalty that requires individuals to re -\\npay subsidy costs for USDA Single-Family Direct \\nloans—a requirement that only exists for rural \\nhousing.  The Budget provides strong support for \\nUSDA’s multifamily housing and housing preser -\\nvation programs.  Through these investments, the \\nAdministration advances equity in support of un -\\nderserved communities by reducing rent burdens \\nfor low-income borrowers and preserving low-\\nincome tenant-based housing in rural America.  \\nThe Budget again proposes to reduce operating \\ncosts and increase the resiliency of rural housing \\nto the impacts of climate change through a pro -\\nposal to require energy and water efficiency im -\\nprovements and green features in USDA’s rural 30 INVeSTING IN AMeRICA AND THe AMeRICAN PeOPLe\\nhousing programs that include construction, such \\nas housing repair loans and grants.\\nSupports and Expands the American \\nClimate Corps.   Last year, the Administration \\nannounced the launch of the American Climate \\nCorps (ACC) to mobilize a new, diverse genera -\\ntion of more than 20,000 clean energy, conser -\\nvation, and climate resilience workers, and this \\nyear, the first cohort of ACC members will begin \\ntheir service.  The ACC will provide job training \\nand service opportunities on a wide range of proj -\\nects that tackle climate change in communities \\naround the Nation.  AmeriCorps is supporting \\nthis new initiative by standing up an ACC hub \\nto provide centralized coordination across seven \\nagencies—AmeriCorps, USDA, DOI, Commerce, \\nDOe, DOL, and ePA—who are charged with \\nimplementing the ACC.  The Budget provides \\n$15\\xa0million to support and expand AmeriCorps’ \\nACC hub and $23\\xa0million to support over 1,700 \\nadditional ACC members, as well as $8\\xa0 billion \\nin mandatory funding to support an additional \\n50,000 ACC members annually by 2031.  This \\nbuilds on additional investments to support cli -\\nmate-related workforce development and service \\ninitiatives across all seven ACC agencies.\\nDelivering for Communities Often Left \\nBehind.   The Administration continues to take \\nbold steps and prioritize efforts to deliver environ -\\nmental justice in communities across the United \\nStates, including implementing the President’s \\nJustice40 Initiative and keeping up the momen -\\ntum of the historic Bipartisan Infrastructure \\nLaw and Inflation Reduction Act environmental \\njustice investments.  The Budget bolsters these \\nefforts by supporting several key initiatives to ac -\\ncelerate energy equity and justice for historically \\nexcluded communities to benefit all Americans, \\nand by investing nearly $1.5\\xa0billion across ePA \\nin support of environmental justice efforts, in -\\ncluding investments that would support cleaner \\nair and cleaner water in frontline communities.  \\nThis includes a new $25\\xa0million grant to devel -\\nop Direct Implementation Tribal Cooperative \\nAgreements to carry out crucial ePA programs in \\nIndian Country with an emphasis on addressing \\nthe impacts of climate change. Reduces Health and Environmental \\nHazards for At-Risk Communities.   The \\nBudget provides $8.2\\xa0 billion to address legacy \\nwaste and contamination in communities used \\nduring the Manhattan Project and the Cold War \\nfor nuclear weapons production, as well as other \\nkey investments in programs that reduce envi -\\nronmental hazards like ePA’s Superfund pro -\\ngram, Brownfields program, and Toxic Substances \\nControl Act enforcement.  The Administration \\nwould ensure the investments for the manage -\\nment of toxic chemicals, including per-and poly -\\nfluoroalkyl substances, cleanup of legacy pollu -\\ntion, and long-term stewardship of these sites \\nalign with the Justice40 Initiative to benefit dis -\\nadvantaged communities. \\nInvests in Clean Air.   The Budget provides \\na total of $1.5\\xa0billion for ePA’s Office of Air and \\nRadiation, an increase of $690\\xa0million since the \\nbeginning of the Administration, to continue the \\ndevelopment of national programs, policies, and \\nregulations that control air pollution and radia -\\ntion exposure.  This funding includes a historic \\n$187\\xa0 million for the Atmospheric Protection \\nProgram to support implementation and compli -\\nance with GHG emission standards and to tackle \\nthe climate crisis at home and abroad.  Also in -\\ncluded is $100\\xa0 million for the Diesel emissions \\nReduction Act grant program, which funds grants \\nand rebates to reduce harmful emissions from \\ndiesel engines, and $70\\xa0million for the Targeted \\nAirshed Grants program, which helps reduce air \\npollution in the most polluted nonattainment ar -\\neas.  The Administration continues to support in -\\nvestment in ePA’s work of limiting emissions of \\nharmful air pollutants and tackling the climate \\ncrisis. \\nDoubling Down on America’s \\nGlobal Climate Leadership\\nAchieves the Administration’s Historic \\nClimate Finance Pledge.   The Budget provides \\na path to achieving the President’s $11\\xa0 billion \\ncommitment for international climate finance, in -\\ncluding $3\\xa0billion for the President’s Emergency \\nPlan for Adaptation and Resilience (PREPARE) .  BUDGeT OF THe U. S. GOVeRNMeNT FOR FISCAL YeAR 2025 31\\nA signature initiative, PRePARe supports more \\nthan half a billion people in developing countries \\nto adapt to and manage the impacts of climate \\nchange.  The Budget also supports a $500\\xa0million \\n2025 contribution through mandatory funding to \\nfinance the Green Climate Fund, as part of the \\n$3\\xa0billion multiyear pledge to expand climate ad -\\naptation and mitigation projects in developing countries, and $100\\xa0million for the Amazon Fund \\nto combat deforestation and preserve the world’s \\nlargest tropical rainforest.  The Budget builds \\non historic international climate finance prog -\\nress made over the course of the Administration, \\nin which estimated 2023 levels of $9.5\\xa0 billion \\nrepresent a near-six-fold increase from 2021.  \\nEXPANDING OPPORTUNITY, ADVANCING EQUITY, AND DELIVERING \\nFOR COMMUNITIES NATIONWIDE\\nSince taking office, the President has fought \\nto create opportunity and advance equity—not \\nas a one-year project, but as part of a sustained \\ncommitment to make the promise of America \\nreal for every American, including rural com -\\nmunities, communities of color, women and girls, \\ntribal communities, Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, \\nTransgender, Queer, and Intersex individuals, \\npeople with disabilities, and communities im -\\npacted by persistent poverty.  Since day one, the \\nAdministration has made significant progress ad -\\nvancing equity across the Federal Government, \\nincluding by reinvigorating Federal civil rights \\nenforcements, prioritizing the advancement of \\ngender equity and equality, expanding access to \\nopportunities in underserved communities, in -\\ncreasing food security, advancing efforts to end \\nhomelessness, improving children’s education, \\nupholding the United States’ promise to tribal \\ncommunities, and honoring the Nation’s commit -\\nment to America’s veterans and servicemembers.  \\nThe Budget builds on that progress by making \\nhistoric investments to support the advancement \\nof all Americans—especially in underserved com -\\nmunities—and combat racial and gender dispari -\\nties across the Nation, including in health, educa -\\ntion, and economic opportunity.\\nInvesting in American Families\\nSupports a Strong Nutrition Safety Net.   \\nThe Budget provides $8.5\\xa0billion for critical nu -\\ntrition programs, including $7.7\\xa0 billion to fully \\nfund participation in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and \\nChildren (WIC), which is critical to the health \\nof pregnant women, new mothers, infants, and \\nyoung children.  This program helps low-in -\\ncome families put nutritious food on the table \\nand addresses racial disparities in maternal \\nand child health outcomes.  In the Biden-Harris \\nAdministration National Strategy on Hunger, \\nNutrition, and Health , the Administration set \\ngoals to help more individuals experiencing food \\ninsecurity access Federal nutrition assistance \\nprograms.  By investing in outreach and modern -\\nization, WIC would reach 800,000 more women, \\ninfants, and children each month, providing vital \\nnutrition assistance to nearly seven million indi -\\nviduals, up from 6.2 million in 2021.  The Budget \\nsupports enhanced benefits for fruits and vegeta -\\nbles to improve nutritional outcomes and reduce \\nfood insecurity among children consistent with \\nthe recommendations by the National Academies \\nof Science, engineering, and Medicine.  In ad -\\ndition, the Budget includes an emergency con -\\ntingency fund that would provide additional \\nresources, beyond the $7.7\\xa0 billion, when there \\nare unanticipated cost pressures.  The Budget \\nalso includes $15\\xa0 billion over 10 years to allow \\nmore States and schools to leverage participation \\nin the Community eligibility Provision to pro -\\nvide\\xa0healthy school meals at no cost to an addi -\\ntional nine million children.\\nAdvances Efforts to End Homelessness.   \\nThe Budget provides $4.1\\xa0billion, an increase of \\n$427\\xa0 million over the 2023 level, for Homeless \\nAssistance Grants to continue supporting 32 INVeSTING IN AMeRICA AND THe AMeRICAN PeOPLe\\napproximately 1.2 million people experiencing \\nhomelessness each year and to expand assistance \\nto approximately 25,000 additional households, \\nspecifically survivors of domestic violence and \\nhomeless youth.  In addition, the Administration \\nplans to use approximately $100\\xa0million in pro -\\ngram recaptures to fund coordinated interven -\\ntions to support nearly 11,000 additional home -\\nless individuals and families.  These new resources \\nsupport the Administration’s commitment to the \\ngoals laid out in the All In:  Federal Strategic Plan \\nto Prevent and End Homelessness  and build on \\nefforts that have expanded assistance to rough -\\nly 140,000 additional households experiencing \\nhomelessness since the President took office.  The \\nBudget also provides $505\\xa0million, or $6\\xa0million \\nabove the 2023 level, for Housing Opportunities \\nfor Persons with AIDS, serving a population with a \\ndisproportionately high rate of homelessness and \\nproviding a critical link to services.  The Budget \\nfurther reflects the Administration’s commitment \\nto make progress toward ending homelessness by \\nproviding $8\\xa0billion in mandatory funding for the \\nacquisition, construction, or operation of housing \\nto expand housing options for people experienc -\\ning or at-risk of homelessness, as well as $3\\xa0bil -\\nlion in mandatory funding for grants to provide \\ncounseling and emergency rental assistance to \\nolder adult renters at-risk of homelessness.\\nExpanding Access to Quality \\nEducation and Supporting Students\\nBuilds a Strong Foundation for Families \\nwith Universal Pre-K and Head Start.   The \\nBudget funds voluntary, universal, free preschool \\nfor all four million of the Nation’s four-year-olds \\nand charts a path to expand preschool to three-\\nyear-olds.  High-quality preschool would be of -\\nfered in the setting of the parent’s choice—from \\npublic schools to child care providers to Head \\nStart.  In addition, the Budget increases Head \\nStart funding by $544\\xa0 million to support the \\nAdministration’s goal to reach pay parity be -\\ntween Head Start staff and public elementary \\nschool teachers with similar qualifications over \\ntime.  Together these proposals would support \\nhealthy child development, help children enter kindergarten ready to learn, and support families \\nby reducing their costs prior to school entry and \\nallowing parents to work. \\nAddresses Critical Educator Shortages.   \\nWhile the education sector has faced shortages in \\ncritical staffing areas for decades, these shortages \\nhave grown worse since the COVID-19 pandemic, \\nhighlighting the importance of retaining educa -\\ntors and building strong, diverse pipelines into \\nthe profession.  Since 2021, the Administration \\nhas supported schools in addressing educator \\nshortages, including by supporting the expan -\\nsion of evidence-based pathways such as residen -\\ncies and grow your own programs, which may \\nbe provided through teacher registered appren -\\nticeships.  The Budget includes $90\\xa0 million for \\nSupporting effective education Development, \\n$95\\xa0million for the Teacher Quality Partnership \\nprogram, and doubles funding to $30\\xa0million for \\nthe Hawkins Centers of excellence program, to \\nexpand the number of prospective teachers who \\nhave access to comprehensive, high-quality path -\\nways and improve the diversity of the teacher \\npipeline.  The Budget also includes critical invest -\\nments in recruitment and retention of teachers \\nand school leaders, and provides $173\\xa0million for \\nthe Teacher and School Leader Incentive Fund. \\nIncreases Support for Children with \\nDisabilities.   To support high-quality spe -\\ncial education services for over seven million \\nPre-K through 12 students with disabilities, the \\nBudget provides $14.4\\xa0 billion for Individuals \\nwith Disabilities education Act (IDeA) State \\nGrants, a $200\\xa0million increase over the 2023 en -\\nacted level.  Since 2021, the Administration has \\nsecured a $1.3\\xa0billion, or 10-percent increase in \\nannual funding for the program as well as an \\nadditional $2.6\\xa0billion in American Rescue Plan \\nfunds to help students with disabilities recover \\nfrom the COVID-19 pandemic.  The Budget also \\ninvests $545\\xa0million in IDeA Grants for Infants \\nand Families to provide early intervention ser -\\nvices to infants and toddlers with disabilities.  \\nTo address nationwide special educator short -\\nages, the Budget also invests $125\\xa0million, which \\nis $10\\xa0 million above the 2023 enacted level, in \\ngrants to prepare special education and early BUDGeT OF THe U. S. GOVeRNMeNT FOR FISCAL YeAR 2025 33\\nintervention personnel—addressing another crit -\\nical educator shortage area. \\nSupports Students in Schools with High \\nRates of Poverty.   The disruptive effects of the \\nCOVID-19 pandemic on student learning and \\nwell-being have added new urgency to the work \\nof schools.  The Budget includes $8\\xa0billion in man -\\ndatory funding to provide Academic Acceleration \\nand Achievement Grants to high-need school \\ndistricts to help close opportunity and achieve -\\nment gaps and speed the pace of learning recov -\\nery.  These grants would support evidence-based \\nstrategies to increase school attendance, provide \\nhigh-quality tutoring and student supports, and \\nexpand learning time, including both in the sum -\\nmer and in extended day or afterschool programs.  \\nTo help ensure that every student receives the \\nhigh-quality education and support they de -\\nserve, the Budget also provides $18.6\\xa0billion for \\nTitle I, a $200\\xa0 million increase above the 2023 \\nenacted level.  This funding amount is $2.1\\xa0bil -\\nlion higher than when the President took office, \\nreflecting the President’s strong commitment to \\nexpanding support for every American student.  \\nTitle I, which reaches 90 percent of school dis -\\ntricts across the Nation, delivers critical funding \\nto public schools in low-income communities so \\nthey can provide their students with the learn -\\ning opportunities needed to recover academically \\nfrom the COVID-19 pandemic and be successful \\nafter graduation.  \\nImproves College Affordability and \\nProvides Free Community College.   To help \\nlow-and middle-income students overcome fi -\\nnancial barriers to postsecondary education, the \\nBudget proposes to increase the discretionary \\nmaximum Pell Grant by $100 and thereby ex -\\npand the reach of the program to over 7.2 million \\nstudents.  The Budget builds on successful bipar -\\ntisan efforts to increase the maximum Pell Grant \\naward by $900 over the past two years—the larg -\\nest increase in more than 10 years.  The Budget \\nprovides a path to double the maximum award by \\n2029 for students attending public and non-profit \\ninstitutions.  The Budget excludes for-profit insti -\\ntutions from the mandatory increases due to evi -\\ndence these institutions are least likely to provide good outcomes for students.  The Budget also ex -\\npands free community college across the Nation \\nthrough a Federal-State partnership.  In addi -\\ntion, the Budget provides two years of subsidized \\ntuition for students from families earning less \\nthan $125,000 enrolled in a four-year Historically \\nBlack College and University (HBCU), Tribally \\nControlled College and University (TCCU), or \\nMinority-Serving Institution (MSI).\\xa0 \\nExpands Institutional Capacity at \\nHBCUs, TCCUs, MSIs—including HSIs—and \\nCommunity Colleges.   The Budget increases \\ninstitutional capacity at HBCUs, TCCUs, MSIs—\\nincluding HSIs—and under-resourced institu -\\ntions, including community colleges, by providing \\nan increase of $93\\xa0million above the 2023 enacted \\nlevel.  The Budget funding level is $329\\xa0million \\nhigher than the 2021 enacted level, underscor -\\ning the President’s commitment to increasing \\nfunding to historically under-served institutions.  \\nThe Budget also doubles funding by providing \\n$100\\xa0 million for four-year HBCUs, TCCUs, and \\nMSIs to expand research and development in -\\nfrastructure at these institutions, a program the \\nPresident has championed since his first year in \\noffice to address historic disparities in Federal \\nresearch and development funding to HBCUs, \\nTCCUs, and MSIs. \\nPromotes Equity in STEM Education and \\nWorkforce Training.   In support of the CHIPS \\nand Science Act’s priority of building a diverse, \\nSTeM-capable workforce, the Budget provides \\n$1.4\\xa0 billion for STeM education and workforce \\ndevelopment programs at NSF that have an em -\\nphasis on diversity, equity, inclusion, and acces -\\nsibility.  The Budget also includes funding for \\nprograms focused on increasing the participa -\\ntion of groups historically underrepresented in \\nscience and engineering fields, including women \\nand girls and people of color, by supporting:  cur -\\nriculum program design; research on successful \\nrecruitment and retention methods; development \\nof outreach or mentorship programs; and fellow -\\nships.  The Budget also includes $256\\xa0million in \\nfunding to build capacity for advancing energy \\nresearch and developing a new energy workforce \\nthrough programs at HBCUs, TCCUs, MSIs, 34 INVeSTING IN AMeRICA AND THe AMeRICAN PeOPLe\\ntribal colleges, community colleges, and emerg -\\ning research institutions.  The Budget also pro -\\nvides $46\\xa0million to NASA’s Minority University \\nResearch and education Project, to increase com -\\npetitive awards to MSIs to recruit and retain \\nunderrepresented and underserved students in \\nSTeM fields.\\nBolsters Mental Health Supports for \\nAll Students.   The mental health of students, \\nteachers, and school staff is essential for their \\noverall well-being and continued academic re -\\ncovery, and continues to be a high priority of \\nthe Administration, which has delivered an ad -\\nditional $2.1\\xa0 billion to mental health programs \\nsince 2021.  Research shows that students who \\nreceive social, emotional, mental, and behavioral \\nsupports have better outcomes, including per -\\nforming better academically.  The Budget pro -\\nvides a combined total of $216\\xa0million for mental \\nhealth programs, including $200\\xa0million from the \\nBipartisan Safer Communities Act, a 900-percent \\nincrease in program funding since 2021.  These \\nfunds would help increase the number of school-\\nbased counselors, psychologists, social workers, \\nand other mental health professionals in K-12 \\nschools. \\nHonoring America’s Commitments to \\nAmerica’s Veterans and Servicemembers\\nExpands Healthcare, Benefits, and \\nServices for Environmental Exposures.   The \\nSergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring \\nour Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics \\nAct of 2022 (PACT Act) represented the most \\nsignificant expansion of Department of Veterans \\nAffairs (VA) healthcare and disability compensa -\\ntion benefits for veterans exposed to burn pits \\nand other environmental exposures in 30 years.  \\nAs part of the PACT Act, the Congress authorized \\nthe Cost of War Toxic exposures Fund (TeF) to \\nfund increased costs above 2021 funding levels \\nfor healthcare and benefits delivery for veterans \\nexposed to certain environmental hazards—and \\nensure there is sufficient funding available to \\ncover these costs without shortchanging other \\nelements of veteran medical care and benefits delivery.  The Budget continues this commit -\\nment and includes $24.5\\xa0 billion for the TeF in \\n2025, through funds appropriated by the Fiscal \\nResponsibility Act (FRA), which is $19.5\\xa0 billion \\nabove the 2023 enacted level.  \\nStrengthens VA Medical Care and Invests \\nin Critical Veteran Medical Facilities.   The \\nBudget provides a total of $112.6\\xa0billion in dis -\\ncretionary medical care funding in 2025, equal \\nto the 2025 advance appropriation request.  In \\naddition, the Budget, through funds appropri -\\nated by the FRA, includes $21.5\\xa0 billion in TeF \\nfor medical care, bringing the medical care total \\nto $134\\xa0billion in 2025, an $11.5\\xa0billion increase \\nover the 2023 enacted level.  In addition to fully \\nfunding inpatient, outpatient, mental health, and \\nlong-term care services, the Budget supports pro -\\ngrams that enhance VA healthcare quality and \\ndelivery, including a $2\\xa0 billion investment for \\nnon-recurring maintenance to improve medical \\nfacility infrastructure, and continued efforts to \\naddress the opioid and drug overdose epidemic.  \\nThe Budget also includes $2.8\\xa0billion in budget -\\nary resources for construction and expansion of \\ncritical infrastructure and facilities. \\nPrioritizes Mental Health Services, \\nSuicide Prevention, and Sexual Assault \\nPrevention for Military Servicemembers \\nand Veterans.   The Budget invests $135\\xa0million \\nwithin VA research programs, together with \\n$17.1\\xa0billion within the VA Medical Care program, \\nto increase access to quality mental healthcare, \\nwith the goal of helping veterans take charge of \\ntheir treatment and live full, meaningful lives.  \\nIn addition, the Budget provides $583\\xa0 million \\nto further advance the Administration’s veteran \\nsuicide prevention initiatives, including contin -\\nued support of the Veterans Crisis Line’s 988 \\nand additional support for VA’s National Suicide \\nPrevention Strategy.  The Budget also includes \\nfunding to support DOD’s efforts on Suicide \\nPrevention and Response and implements rec -\\nommendations from the Suicide Prevention and \\nResponse Independent Review Committee.  This \\nfunding would support improving the delivery of \\nmental healthcare, addressing stigma and oth -\\ner barriers to care, revising suicide prevention BUDGeT OF THe U. S. GOVeRNMeNT FOR FISCAL YeAR 2025 35\\ntraining, and promoting a culture of lethal means \\nsafety within the military.  The Budget also in -\\ncludes funding to support DOD’s efforts on Sexual \\nAssault Prevention designed to increase aware -\\nness, provide support mechanisms to victims, and \\nsignificantly reduce the environment for, toler -\\nance of, and occurrence of sexual assault in the \\nJoint Force.\\nSupports Women Veterans’ Healthcare.   \\nThe Budget invests $13.7\\xa0billion for women vet -\\nerans’ healthcare, including $1.1\\xa0 billion toward \\nwomen’s gender-specific care.  More women are \\nchoosing VA healthcare than ever before, with \\nwomen accounting for over 30 percent of the \\nincrease in enrolled veterans over the past five \\nyears.  These investments support comprehen -\\nsive specialty medical and surgical services for \\nwomen veterans, improve maternal health out -\\ncomes, increase access to infertility counseling \\nand assisted reproductive technology, and elimi -\\nnate copayments for contraceptive coverage.  \\nThe Budget also improves the safety of women \\nveterans seeking healthcare at VA facilities by \\nsupporting implementation of the zero-tolerance \\npolicy for sexual harassment and assault.\\nBolsters Efforts to End Veteran \\nHomelessness.   The President believes that \\nevery veteran should have permanent, safe, and \\nsustainable housing with access to healthcare and \\nother supportive services.  The Budget invests \\n$3.2\\xa0billion to end current veteran homelessness \\nand prevent veterans from becoming homeless \\nin the future.  In addition to investments made \\nin VA programs, the Budget for HUD provides \\n$13\\xa0billion in mandatory funding to expand the \\nHCV program to reach an additional 400,000 eLI \\nveteran families, paving a path to guaranteed as -\\nsistance for all who have served the Nation and \\nare in need.\\nInvests in Overdose Prevention and \\nTreatment Programs.   The Budget invests \\n$713\\xa0million toward opioid use disorder preven -\\ntion and treatment programs for veterans, in -\\ncluding using predictive analytics to stratify a \\npatient’s risk of overdose, provide augmented \\ncare as appropriate, and to support programs authorized in the Jason Simcakoski PROMISe \\nAct.  In addition, investments contribute to distri -\\nbution of naloxone to veterans, which, according \\nto researchers with the VA Palo Alto Health Care \\nSystem, has demonstrated success in effective uti -\\nlization of the lifesaving opioid overdose reversal \\nmedication, and development of an opioid safety \\ntoolkit that provides clinicians materials that aid \\nin decisions related to safe opioid prescribing and \\nnon-opioid pain management options. \\nFulfills America’s Commitment to \\nMilitary Families.   Military families are key to \\nthe readiness and well-being of the All-Volunteer \\nForce, and therefore are critical to national secu -\\nrity.  The Budget continues to support military \\nfamilies by prioritizing programs, including the \\nSecretary of Defense’s Taking Care of People ini -\\ntiatives, that seek to increase access to behavioral \\nhealth providers.  The Budget also continues to \\nsupport the establishment of universal pre-school \\nfor military children at DOD education Activity \\nschools, both stateside and overseas, to ensure no \\nmilitary child faces barriers to accessing early \\nchildhood education due to where their parents \\nare stationed.  The Budget provides critical fund -\\ning for the VA Program of General Caregivers \\nSupport Services, as well as $2.9\\xa0billion for the \\nProgram of Comprehensive Assistance for Family \\nCaregivers, which includes stipend payments and \\nsupport services to help empower family caregiv -\\ners of eligible veterans. \\nSupports Economic Security for Military \\nFamilies.   Military families, like their civilian \\ncounterparts, increasingly look to rely upon dual \\nincomes.  However, the 21-percent unemploy -\\nment rate experienced by active-duty military \\nspouses makes that a difficult goal to achieve and \\nmaintain.  The President continues to prioritize \\nefforts to make the Federal Government the em -\\nployer of choice for military spouses.\\xa0 In addition, \\nthe Administration understands that access to \\nhigh-quality, affordable child care is a necessity \\nfor working families, and a military readiness is -\\nsue.  The Budget continues to support increases \\nto high-quality child care for military families via \\nthe Child Care Workforce Initiative.  The Budget \\nalso proposes to increase the income eligibility 36 INVeSTING IN AMeRICA AND THe AMeRICAN PeOPLe\\nthreshold for the Basic Needs Allowance from \\n150 percent to 200 percent of the Federal Poverty \\nGuidelines.  \\nDelivering for Tribal Communities\\nGuarantees Adequate and Stable Funding \\nfor IHS.   The Administration is committed to up -\\nholding the United States’ responsibility to tribal \\nnations by addressing the historical underfund -\\ning of IHS.  The enactment of an advance appro -\\npriation for 2024 for IHS was a historic and wel -\\ncome step toward the goal of securing adequate \\nand stable funding for IHS that will provide \\nneeded improvements in access to care and the \\noverall health status of American Indians and \\nAlaska Natives.  The Budget requests $8\\xa0billion \\nin discretionary resources in 2025, including in -\\ncreases for clinical services, preventative health, \\nfacilities construction, contract support costs, \\nand tribal leases.  Beginning in 2026, the Budget \\nproposes all resources as mandatory.  Mandatory \\nfunding would close longstanding service and fa -\\ncility shortfalls over time, improve access to high-\\nquality healthcare, and fund key Administration \\npriorities such as the Biden Cancer Moonshot.  \\nThe Budget also proposes to reauthorize and in -\\ncrease funding for the Special Diabetes Program \\nfor Indians, which has been critical in lowering \\nthe prevalence of diabetes in Indian Country. \\nHonors Commitments to Support Tribal \\nCommunities.   Incorporating feedback from \\ntribal consultations, the Budget continues to pro -\\nvide robust support for indigenous communities \\nin keeping with U.S. Federal trust responsibili -\\nties while working to advance equity.  The Budget \\nincludes $4.6\\xa0 billion for DOI’s tribal programs, \\n$514\\xa0 million above the 2023 enacted level and \\nmore than $1\\xa0billion over the 2021 enacted lev -\\nel, to support public safety and justice, human \\nand social services, and education.  The Budget \\ncontinues to propose reclassification of Contract \\nSupport Costs and the Indian Self-Determination \\nAct Section 105(l) leases as mandatory spend -\\ning, beginning in 2026, to provide certainty for \\ntribal communities in meeting these ongoing requirements with dedicated funding.  Budget \\nresources across DOI’s tribal programs build on \\nhistoric investments in the American Rescue \\nPlan and complement Inflation Reduction Act \\nand Bipartisan Infrastructure Law investments \\nto ensure long-term success in addressing criti -\\ncal infrastructure and climate adaptation needs \\nin indigenous communities.  The Budget sup -\\nports the Administration’s commitment to pri -\\noritize restoration of healthy and abundant wild \\nsalmon, steelhead, and other native fish popu -\\nlations in the Columbia River Basin, and honor \\nthe United States’ obligations to tribal nations.  \\nThis includes $145\\xa0million through the Corps of \\nengineers, a 123-percent, or $80\\xa0million increase \\nabove the 2023 enacted level, $19\\xa0million through \\nthe Bureau of Reclamation, and $34\\xa0 million \\nthrough NOAA to enhance restoration efforts in \\nthe watershed.\\nInvests in Affordable Housing in Tribal \\nCommunities.   Native Americans are seven \\ntimes more likely to live in overcrowded condi -\\ntions and five times more likely to have inad -\\nequate plumbing, kitchen, or heating systems \\nthan all U.S. households.  The Budget provides \\n$1.1\\xa0billion, a $33\\xa0million increase above the 2023 \\nlevel, at HUD to support tribal efforts to expand \\naffordable housing, improve housing conditions \\nand infrastructure, and increase economic op -\\nportunities for low-income families.  Of this total, \\n$150\\xa0million would prioritize activities that ad -\\nvance resilience and energy efficiency in housing-\\nrelated projects. \\nCommits to Tribal Water Rights \\nSettlements Funding.   The Budget builds on \\nBipartisan Infrastructure Law investments by \\nproviding $2.8\\xa0 billion in additional mandatory \\nfunding to the Indian Water Rights Settlement \\nCompletion Fund, as well as $226\\xa0million in dis -\\ncretionary funding to meet existing settlement \\nobligations.  This funding would ensure stable, \\ndedicated funding for tribal water rights settle -\\nments, which is crucial for safe, reliable water \\nsupplies to improve public and environmental \\nhealth and support economic opportunity in trib -\\nal communities.

The Budget builds on this \\nprogress with proposals to continue:  investing in \\nState, local, tribal, and Federal law enforcement; \\nadvancing much-needed reforms to the crimi -\\nnal justice system; reducing gun violence and \\ncrime; revitalizing U.S. alliances and partner -\\nships, confronting global threats and strengthen -\\ning America’s military; securing the border and \\nstrengthening the U.S. immigration system; ad -\\nvancing U.S. national security to Out-Compete \\nChina and counter Russian aggression; and ad -\\ndressing pressing global challenges.\\nTackling Crime, Reducing \\nGun Violence, and Making \\nAmerica’s Communities Safer\\nInvests in Federal Law Enforcement to \\nCombat Gun Violence and Other Violent \\nCrime.    The Budget makes significant invest -\\nments to bolster Federal law enforcement ca -\\npacity to strengthen public safety.  The Budget \\nincludes $17.7\\xa0billion, an increase of $1.1\\xa0billion \\nabove the 2023 enacted level and $2.6\\xa0 billion \\nabove the 2021 enacted level, for DOJ law en -\\nforcement, including $2\\xa0billion for the Bureau of \\nAlcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and explosives to:  ef -\\nfectively investigate and prosecute gun crimes; \\nexpand multijurisdictional gun trafficking strike \\nforces; increase regulation of the firearms in -\\ndustry; bolster crime-solving ballistics, gun -\\nshot residue, and other forensic technologies as \\nwell as analysts; and implement the Bipartisan \\nSafer Communities Act.  The Budget includes \\n$1.9\\xa0billion for the U.S. Marshals Service (USMS) \\nto support efforts to reduce violent crime, in -\\ncluding through fugitive apprehension and en -\\nforcement operations.  The Budget also provides \\n$51\\xa0million to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to support the continued implementation of \\nenhanced background checks, a key provision of \\nthe Bipartisan Safer Communities Act.  In addi -\\ntion, the Budget provides a total of $2.8\\xa0billion for \\nthe U.S. Attorneys, which includes funding for 50 \\nnew attorneys to prosecute violent crimes.  The \\nBudget also requests $15\\xa0million for the Jabara-\\nHeyer NO HATe Act, an increase of $5\\xa0million \\nover the 2023 enacted level.\\nPursues New Mandatory Investments to \\nCombat Violent Crime and Support Victims.  \\nThe Budget builds upon the Safer America Plan \\nby investing an additional $1.2\\xa0billion over five \\nyears to launch a new Violent Crime Reduction \\nand Prevention Fund to give Federal, State, local, \\ntribal, and territorial law enforcement the dedi -\\ncated, seasoned, and full support they need to fo -\\ncus on violent crime.  This investment includes \\nhiring new Federal law enforcement agents, pros -\\necutors, and forensic specialists to address vio -\\nlent crime, expand Federal operations to combat \\nfentanyl and apprehend dangerous fugitives, and \\nsupport for the hiring of 4,700 detectives at the \\nState and local level to solve homicides, non-fatal \\nshootings, and other violent crimes to drive down \\nthe high rate of unsolved violent crimes and the \\nlengthy delays that undermine public trust and \\npublic safety.  In addition, $28\\xa0million is provid -\\ned to expand the USMS’s Operation North Star, \\nwhich has taken more than 6,700 of the most \\ndangerous State and local fugitives off the street \\nsince 2021, to 100 more cities over five years, in -\\ncluding 20 more cities in 2025 in order to drive \\ndown violent crime.  This investment also ex -\\npands Drug enforcement Administration (DeA) \\nOperation Overdrive, which uses a data-driven, \\nintelligence-led approach to identify and disman -\\ntle violent drug trafficking networks, to 50 more \\ncities that are experiencing high rates of gun vio -\\nlence and fentanyl overdoses for 45-day opera -\\ntions.  The Budget also requests $7.3\\xa0 billion to \\nreplenish the Crime Victims Fund and ensure a \\nstable and predictable source of funding is avail -\\nable to support critical victim service and com -\\npensation programs over the next decade. 38 INVeSTING IN AMeRICA AND THe AMeRICAN PeOPLe\\nCombats Narcotics Trafficking Networks.  \\nThe Budget provides $3.3\\xa0billion to the DeA to \\ncombat drug trafficking, including $1.2\\xa0billion to \\ncombat opioid trafficking, save lives, and make \\ncommunities safer.  The Budget invests an addi -\\ntional $18\\xa0million in Domestic Counter-Fentanyl \\nThreat Targeting Teams at the Drug enforcement \\nAdministration to enhance America’s fight \\nagainst the transnational criminal networks \\npushing deadly illicit fentanyl in America’s com -\\nmunities.  These interdisciplinary teams of spe -\\ncial agents, intelligence analysts, and data ex -\\nperts would map criminal organizations and \\nbuild cases that lead to the dismantling of entire \\ndrug trafficking networks and the deprivation \\nof hundreds of millions of dollars to the Sinaloa \\nand Jalisco cartels.  In addition, the Budget pro -\\nvides $494\\xa0 million in grants supporting efforts \\nto address substance use, including $190\\xa0million \\nfor the Comprehensive Opioid, Stimulant, and \\nSubstance Use Program, $95\\xa0million to support \\nDrug Courts, and $51\\xa0million for anti-drug task \\nforces. \\nDisrupts the International Synthetic Drug \\nTrade.   The Budget includes $169\\xa0million across \\nthe Department of State and the U.S. Agency for \\nInternational Development (USAID) to counter \\nfentanyl and other synthetic drug production \\nand trafficking, which is 58 percent above 2023 \\nenacted levels.  These resources would counter \\nthe worldwide flow of fentanyl and other synthet -\\nics that endanger public safety and health, and \\ncontribute to tens of thousands of drug-overdose \\ndeaths in the United States annually.\\nSupports State, Local, and Tribal Law \\nEnforcement and Public Safety.   The Budget \\nprovides $3.7\\xa0 billion in discretionary resources \\nfor State and local grants and $30.3\\xa0 billion in \\nmandatory resources to support State, local, and \\ntribal efforts to protect U.S. communities and pro -\\nmote public safety through the President’s Safer \\nAmerica Plan.  Through a combination of discre -\\ntionary and mandatory investments, the Safer \\nAmerica Plan supports the President’s goal to \\nrecruit, train, support, and hire 100,000 addition -\\nal police officers for effective, accountable com -\\nmunity policing consistent with the standards of the  executive Order 14074, “Advancing \\neffective, Accountable Policing and Criminal \\nJustice Practices To enhance Public Trust and \\nPublic Safety.”  In addition, the Safer America \\nPlan would:  fund bonuses for retention of police \\nofficers; provide student loan repayment, tuition \\nreimbursement, and higher education grant pro -\\ngrams to incentivize service-minded candidates, \\nincluding women and individuals from under -\\nrepresented communities to become officers; sup -\\nport pilot programs to explore more flexibility \\nin scheduling and work arrangements; expand \\nmental health and wellness care for police offi -\\ncers; and fund life-saving equipment.\\xa0 The Safer \\nAmerica Plan would further support the evi -\\ndence-based training of law enforcement on top -\\nics including crime control and deterrence tactics, \\ncommunity engagement, use of force, interacting \\nwith people with disabilities, and responding to \\npersons in mental health crisis and to domestic \\nviolence calls.  The Safer America Plan would also \\nfurther efforts to advance transparency, account -\\nability, and safety to simultaneously strengthen \\npublic safety and public trust consistent with \\nthe standards of executive Order 14074 through \\nfunding to support the purchase and operation \\nof body-worn cameras, modernize police acad -\\nemies and training, comprehensively reform pub -\\nlic safety systems, and combat crime to keep the \\nNation’s streets safe.  The Budget, through the \\nSafer America Plan, provides funding for courts \\naround the Nation to clear their backlogs and \\nimprove accountability and deterrence for people \\non pretrial supervision, and supports technol -\\nogy and data systems modernization necessary \\nto ensure that the justice system runs efficiently \\nand with the most current data, such as:  case \\nmanagement systems that effectively integrate \\npretrial services, judicial, and law enforcement \\nrecords; virtual access and notification systems \\nto facilitate remote check-ins and hearings as \\nappropriate and beneficial for all involved; and \\nscheduling software to manage the increased vol -\\nume of cases.

To achieve \\nthe original goals of the Safer America Plan, the \\nBudget requests an additional $1.5\\xa0 billion in \\nmandatory funding to support CVI programs at \\nthe Department over the next 10 years.\\nPrioritizes Efforts to End Gender-Based \\nViolence.   The Budget proposes $800\\xa0 million \\nto support programs under the Violence Against \\nWomen Act of 1994 (VAWA), which was reau -\\nthorized and strengthened in 2022.  This is a \\n$100\\xa0 million or 14-percent increase over the \\n2023 enacted level, which was the highest fund -\\ning level in history.  The Budget supports sig -\\nnificant increases for longstanding VAWA pro -\\ngrams, including key investments in sexual \\nassault services, transitional housing, and legal \\nassistance for survivors.  The Budget strongly \\nsupports underserved and tribal communities \\nby providing $15\\xa0 million for culturally-specific \\nservices, $5\\xa0million for underserved populations, \\n$25\\xa0 million to assist enforcement of tribal spe -\\ncial domestic violence jurisdiction, $3\\xa0million to \\nsupport tribal Special Assistant U.S. Attorneys, \\nand $10\\xa0million for a new special initiative to ad -\\ndress missing and murdered indigenous people.  \\nThe Budget also provides $10\\xa0million to address \\ntechnology-facilitated abuse through funding \\nnew VAWA programs that address cybercrimes \\nagainst individuals.  In addition, the Budget pro -\\nvides $55\\xa0million to the Office of Justice Programs \\nfor the Sexual Assault Kit Initiative to address \\nthe rape kit backlog.\\nReforms the Federal Criminal Justice \\nSystem.   The Budget leverages the capacity of \\nthe Federal justice system to advance crimi -\\nnal justice reform and serve as a model that is \\ncomprehensive, evidence-based, and that en -\\nhances public safety and equity.  The Budget sup -\\nports key investments in First Step Act (FSA) implementation, including continuing the his -\\ntoric collaboration between the Bureau of Prisons \\nand DOL to provide comprehensive, intensive, \\nand market-driven workforce development and \\nreentry services for people in the Federal prison \\nsystem.  In total, the Budget continues to invest \\n$409\\xa0 million in base resources for FSA imple -\\nmentation, to support rehabilitative program -\\nming, improve confinement conditions, and hire \\nadditional FSA-dedicated staff.\\nSecuring the Border and Strengthening \\nthe Immigration System\\nReiterates the Administration’s Request \\nfor Immediate Funding to Secure the Border, \\nBuild Capacity to Enforce Immigration Law, \\nand Counter Fentanyl.   In October 2023, the \\nAdministration transmitted an emergency sup -\\nplemental request for the Southwest border and \\nmigration issues totaling $11.8\\xa0billion, of which \\n$8.7\\xa0billion was for DHS.  The Budget includes, \\nand therefore reiterates the need for, the unmet \\nneeds from the October 2023 supplemental re -\\nquest.  In addition to urgent requirements, the re -\\nquest includes investments to build longer-term \\ncapacity in the areas of border security, immigra -\\ntion enforcement, and countering fentanyl, total -\\ning $2.9\\xa0billion for DHS.  This amount includes:  \\n$405\\xa0 million to hire 1,300 additional Border \\nPatrol Agents to secure the border; $239\\xa0million to \\nhire 1,000 additional U.S. Customs and Border \\nProtection (CBP) Officers to stop fentanyl and \\nother contraband from entering the United \\nStates; $755\\xa0million to hire an additional 1,600 \\nAsylum Officers and support staff to facilitate \\ntimely immigration dispositions; $100\\xa0million for \\nHomeland Security Investigations to investigate \\nand disrupt transnational criminal organizations \\nand drug traffickers; and $849\\xa0 million for cut -\\nting-edge detection technology at ports of entry.  \\nTaken together, these long-term capacity build -\\ning investments represent the Administration’s \\nvision for ensuring the Nation’s border security \\nand immigration system can effectively respond \\nto challenges present along the border.  In ad -\\ndition to the executive Office for Immigration \\nReview (eOIR) investments, the Budget also 40 INVeSTING IN AMeRICA AND THe AMeRICAN PeOPLe\\nreiterates the $1.7\\xa0billion for DOJ requested in \\nthe Administration’s October 2023 border, immi -\\ngration, and countering fentanyl supplement re -\\nquest.  Of this amount, $1.3\\xa0billion is requested \\nfor eOIR to fund the hiring of 375 new immigra -\\ntion judge teams to help reduce the immigration \\ncase backlog.  In addition, the Administration \\nappreciates the Senate’s bipartisan border legis -\\nlation that would make additional investments \\nin DHS and provide authorities to bolster the \\nDepartment’s efforts to secure and manage the \\nborder.\\nContinues to Invest in Critical Capabilities \\nNeeded for Border and Immigration \\nEnforcement.   Strengthening border security \\nand providing safe, lawful pathways for migra -\\ntion remain top priorities for the Administration.  \\nThe Budget builds on the Administration’s \\n2023 October supplemental request to in -\\nclude $25.9\\xa0billion for CBP and U.S. Immigration \\nand Customs enforcement (ICe), an increase of \\n$1.9\\xa0billion over the 2023 enacted level when con -\\ntrolling for border management amounts.  The \\nBudget includes:  funds for CBP to hire an addi -\\ntional 350 Border Patrol Agents and 310 process -\\ning coordinators; $127\\xa0million for border security \\ntechnology between ports of entry; and $86\\xa0mil -\\nlion in air and maritime operational support that \\nis central to efforts to secure the border.  The \\nBudget also includes:  funds to support 34,000 \\nICe immigration detention beds; $225\\xa0million to \\naddress increased transportation and removal \\ncosts; and $34\\xa0 million to combat child exploita -\\ntion, forced labor, and human trafficking.\\nEnables Resources to Scale Border \\nEnforcement Capacity for Conditions on \\nthe Southwest Border.  Given the uncertain -\\nty surrounding border conditions in any given \\nyear, the Budget proposes a $4.7\\xa0 billion con -\\ntingency fund to aid DHS and its components \\nwhen responding to migration surges along the \\nSouthwest border.  Modeled on a contingency \\nfund provided for unaccompanied children, each \\nfiscal year the fund would receive appropria -\\ntions incrementally, and above the base appro -\\npriation, as Southwest border encounters reach \\npre-identified levels.  DHS would be limited to obligating funds for surge-related functions, and \\nwould transfer funds to CBP, ICe, and Federal \\nemergency Management Agency accounts for \\nvalid surge-related obligations.\\nSupports America’s Promise to Refugees \\nand Care for Unaccompanied Children.   \\nThe Budget builds on the Administration’s \\nOctober 2023 supplemental request and provides \\n$9.3\\xa0billion for the Office of Refugee Resettlement \\n(ORR) to help rebuild the Nation’s refugee reset -\\ntlement infrastructure and support the resettling \\nof up to 125,000 refugees in 2025.  The Budget \\nalso helps ensure that unaccompanied immigrant \\nchildren receive appropriate support and servic -\\nes while they are in ORR’s care and are unified \\nwith relatives and sponsors as safely and quickly \\nas possible.  This funding would allow ORR to \\ncontinue the programmatic improvements the \\nAdministration has made, including expanding \\naccess to counsel to help children navigate com -\\nplex immigration court proceedings and enhanc -\\ning case management and post-release services.  \\nIn addition, the Budget includes an emergency \\ncontingency fund that would provide additional \\nresources, beyond the $9.3\\xa0billion, when there are \\nunanticipated increases in the number of unac -\\ncompanied children.\\nImproves Immigration Courts.   The Budget \\ninvests $981\\xa0million, an increase of $121\\xa0million \\nabove the 2023 enacted level, in eOIR to enhance \\nAmerica’s immigration courts and help address \\nthe backlog of over 2.4\\xa0million currently pending \\ncases.  This funding would support 25 new immi -\\ngration judge teams, which includes the support \\npersonnel necessary to ensure efficient case pro -\\ncessing.  The Budget also invests $30\\xa0million for \\neOIR to partner to with the U.S. Digital Service \\nto develop and implement digital court operations \\nstrategies that would maximize each judge’s adju -\\ndicatory capacity and help reduce the case back -\\nlog.  In addition to eOIR investments, the Budget \\nalso reiterates the $1.7\\xa0billion for DOJ request -\\ned in the Administration’s October 2023 border, \\nimmigration, and countering fentanyl supple -\\nment request.  Of this amount, $1.3\\xa0billion is re -\\nquested for eOIR to fund the hiring of 375\\xa0new BUDGeT OF THe U. S. GOVeRNMeNT FOR FISCAL YeAR 2025 41\\nimmigration judge teams to help reduce the im -\\nmigration case backlog.\\nConfronting Threats to Global Security \\nand Strengthening America’s Military\\nReiterates the Administration’s Request \\nfor Immediate Funding for Urgent National \\nSecurity Priorities Related to Ukraine, \\nIsrael, and the Indo-Pacific.   In October 2023, \\nthe Administration transmitted an emergency \\nsupplemental request totaling $92\\xa0 billion to \\nthe Congress for urgent national security needs \\nthrough the end of 2024, of which $58\\xa0 billion \\nwas for DOD, $32\\xa0billion was for the Department \\nof State and the U.S. Agency for International \\nDevelopment, and $2\\xa0billion for the Department \\nof the Treasury (Treasury).  This request includ -\\ned $61.4\\xa0billion to support Ukraine as it contin -\\nues to defend itself against Russian aggression, \\n$14.3\\xa0 billion to support Israel’s defense against \\nterrorism, $10\\xa0billion for lifesaving humanitarian \\nassistance, including for the Palestinian people, \\n$3.4\\xa0 billion for the Submarine Industrial Base \\n(SIB), and $4\\xa0billion in other national security pri -\\norities.  The request would also make significant \\nand much needed investments in the American \\ndefense industrial base (DIB), benefitting U.S. \\nmilitary readiness and helping to create and sus -\\ntain jobs across America.  Absent congressional \\naction on this emergency request, the United \\nStates would not be able to provide the necss -\\nsary  support to Ukraine, provide urgently need -\\ned military support to allies and partners, make \\ncritical DIB investments, or sustain lifesaving as -\\nsistance and development in some of the world’s \\nmost vulnerable areas.  The Administration ap -\\npreciates the bipartisan supplemental legislation \\nthat passed the Senate that would address these \\nurgent needs.\\nSupports Ukraine, European Allies, and \\nPartners.   The Budget continues to provide \\ncritical support for Ukraine, the North Atlantic \\nTreaty Organization allies, and other european \\npartner states by prioritizing funding to en -\\nhance the capabilities and readiness of U.S., al -\\nlied, and partner forces in the face of continued Russian aggression.  The Budget includes a \\nnew capital increase to the european Bank for \\nReconstruction and Development to maintain \\nsupport to Ukraine and deliver on multilateral \\ndevelopment bank evolution reforms.  However, \\nthe Budget cannot address the critical support to \\nUkraine, which requires congressional action on \\nthe Administration’s October 2023 national secu -\\nrity supplemental request. \\nPromotes Integrated Deterrence in the \\nIndo-Pacific and Globally.   To sustain and \\nstrengthen deterrence, the Budget provides \\nfunding to prioritize China as America’s pac -\\ning challenge in line with the 2022 National \\nDefense Strategy .  DOD’s 2025 Pacific Deterrence \\nInitiative  highlights some of the key investments \\nthe Federal Government is making, focuses on \\nstrengthening deterrence in the region, and dem -\\nonstrates the Administration’s long-term com -\\nmitment to the Indo-Pacific.  DOD is building the \\nconcepts, capabilities, and posture necessary to \\nmeet these challenges, working to integrate de -\\nterrence efforts across the U.S. Government and \\nwith U.S. allies and partners. \\nUnderpins Commitments to Nuclear \\nDeterrence, Nonproliferation, and Arms \\nControl.   Nuclear deterrence remains a top pri -\\nority for the Nation and is foundational to inte -\\ngrated deterrence.  A safe, secure, and effective \\nnuclear force deters strategic attacks and as -\\nsures allies and partners.  To ensure the United \\nStates’ nuclear deterrent remains responsive to \\nall threats, DOD and DOe continue to modern -\\nize the nuclear Triad, nuclear command, control, \\nand communications, and nuclear weapons in -\\nfrastructure, while strengthening extended de -\\nterrence commitments to America’s allies.  The \\nBudget also supports the President’s commitment \\nto reduce nuclear risks and strengthen the global \\nnon-proliferation regime by simultaneously pur -\\nsuing realistic goals for mutual, verifiable arms \\ncontrol and efforts to protect against the existen -\\ntial threats posed by weapons of mass destruction \\nterrorism.  \\nEnsures Readiness across America’s \\nArmed Forces.   The Budget continues to ensure 42 INVeSTING IN AMeRICA AND THe AMeRICAN PeOPLe\\nthat U.S. Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, Marines, and \\nGuardians remain the best trained and equipped \\nfighting forces in the world.  The Budget places \\nadditional emphasis on foundational investments \\nto sustain current weapon systems and support \\nincreased training across DOD, while pursuing \\ntechnological enhancements to extend the service \\nlife of material vital to the warfighter.  In addition, \\nthe Budget continues the recapitalization and op -\\ntimization of the four public Naval Shipyards to \\nmeet future submarine and carrier maintenance \\nrequirements.\\nInvests in SIB. \\xa0 DOD conducted the 2025 SIB \\nstudy to determine how to complete the once-in-\\na-generation recapitalization of the submarine \\nforce needed to increase the United States’ ability \\nto build and sustain attack submarines to meet \\nU.S. military requirements.\\xa0 The Budget also sup -\\nports the Administration’s commitments under \\nthe Australia-United Kingdom-United States en -\\nhanced trilateral security partnership, the first \\nmajor deliverable of which was the historic deci -\\nsion to support Australia acquiring conventional -\\nly-armed, nuclear-powered submarines. \\nAddresses Emerging Cyber Threats.   The \\nBudget expands DOJ’s ability to pursue cyber \\nthreats through investments in FBI’s cyber and \\ncounterintelligence investigative capabilities.  \\nThese investments sustain the FBI’s cyber in -\\ntelligence, counterintelligence, and analysis ca -\\npabilities and include an additional $25\\xa0million \\nto enhance those cyber response capabilities.  \\nThe Budget also includes $5\\xa0million to expand a \\nnew section within the DOJ’s National Security \\nDivision to focus on cyber threats.  These invest -\\nments are in line with the National Cybersecurity \\nStrategy  that emphasizes a whole-of-Nation ap -\\nproach to addressing ongoing cyber threats.  The \\nBudget also provides $2\\xa0million for DOJ to support \\nimplementation of the executive Order 14110, \\n“Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and \\nUse of Artificial Intelligence.”\\nCombats Terrorism and Corruption and \\nIncreases Corporate Transparency.   Treasury \\nplays a leading role in monitoring and disrupting \\ncorruption, money laundering, terrorist financing, the use of the financial system by malicious ac -\\ntors domestically and abroad, and combatting \\nthe trafficking of illicit substances such as fen -\\ntanyl in American communities.  The Budget \\nprovides $231\\xa0million to the Office of Terrorism \\nand Financial Intelligence, $15\\xa0million above the \\n2023 level, to expand Treasury’s capacity to pro -\\nvide financial intelligence and conduct sanctions-\\nrelated economic analysis while continuing to \\nmodernize the sanctions process.  These invest -\\nments would expand Treasury’s ability to craft, \\nimplement, and enforce sanctions, including the \\nhistoric sanctions program targeting Russia’s \\nillegal war in Ukraine, and sanctions on key \\nHamas terrorist group members and financial fa -\\ncilitators in Gaza. \\nInvests in AI.   The President issued a land -\\nmark executive Order to ensure that America \\nleads the way in seizing the promise and man -\\naging the risks of AI.  The executive Order es -\\ntablishes new standards for AI safety and se -\\ncurity, protects Americans’ privacy, advances \\nequity and civil rights, stands up for consumers \\nand workers, promotes innovation and competi -\\ntion, advances American leadership around the \\nworld, and more.  The Budget provides funding \\nto responsibly develop, test, procure, and inte -\\ngrate transformative AI applications across the \\nFederal Government and supports the implemen -\\ntation of the Administration’s executive Order.  \\nSpecifically, the National Institute of Standards \\nand Technology (NIST) would establish the U.S. \\nAI Safety Institute to operationalize NIST’s AI \\nRisk Management Framework by creating guide -\\nlines, tools, benchmarks, and best practices for \\nevaluating and mitigating dangerous capabilities \\nand conducting evaluations including red-team -\\ning to identify and mitigate AI risk.\\nAddressing Pressing Global Challenges\\nDrives Inclusive and Sustainable \\nEconomic Growth and Quality International \\nInfrastructure through the Partnership \\nfor Global Infrastructure and Investment \\n(PGI).   The Budget advances the President’s \\ngoal of mobilizing $200\\xa0billion for infrastructure BUDGeT OF THe U. S.

PGI aims to promote infrastructure de -\\nvelopment along critical economic corridors to \\ndrive inclusive and sustainable economic growth, \\nsecure energy supply chains, fortify trusted digi -\\ntal connectivity, and build more resilient food \\nand health systems, as well as critical transport \\nand logistics networks, while advancing gender \\nequality and equity.  The Budget includes ap -\\nproximately $50\\xa0billion for PGI across all depart -\\nments and agencies, inclusive of private sector \\nfinancing leveraged, including $250\\xa0 million in \\nflexible resources to support strategic, high-\\nquality infrastructure to connect workers to good \\njobs, allow businesses to grow and\\xa0 thrive, and \\nadvance shared national security priorities.  To \\nfurther PGI goals, the Budget includes $2\\xa0billion \\nin mandatory funding over five years to establish \\nthe International Infrastructure Fund to combat \\nPeople’s Republic of China coercive financing.  \\nStrengthens Health Systems Globally.   \\nThe Budget provides nearly $10\\xa0billion for glob -\\nal health programs, which would increase sup -\\nport for global health programs, strengthening \\nhealth systems, and pandemic preparedness.  \\nThe Budget fulfills the President’s commitment \\nto the seventh replenishment of the Global Fund \\nto Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria by pro -\\nviding $1.2\\xa0billion to match $1 for every $2 con -\\ntributed by other donors.  The Budget also pro -\\nvides more than $900\\xa0 million for global health \\nsecurity, including $250\\xa0million for the Pandemic \\nFund.  The Budget invests $30\\xa0million in new re -\\nsources for the World Bank’s Global Financing \\nFacility for Women, Children, and Adolescents, \\na contribution anticipated to leverage at least \\n$210\\xa0 million to strengthen health systems, and \\n$20\\xa0 million for the Administration’s Global \\nHealth Worker Initiative to better train, equip, \\nand protect the health workforce.  In addition, \\nthe Budget includes loan guarantees to the World \\nBank’s International Bank for Reconstruction \\nand Development to support investments in glob -\\nal challenges, including pandemic preparedness, \\nwhich would bolster the impact of these global \\nhealth activities.Secures American Presence and \\nCommitment in the Indo-Pacific.   The Budget \\nprovides over $4\\xa0 billion to realize a more free, \\nopen, secure, and connected Indo-Pacific that bol -\\nsters U.S. alliances and partnerships, which is \\nnearly $600\\xa0 million above the 2023 level.  This \\nincludes $2.1\\xa0 billion in bilateral and regional \\nforeign assistance, including $100\\xa0 million for \\na standalone request for Taiwan military as -\\nsistance, and $20\\xa0 million for the Indo-Pacific \\neconomic Framework.  The Budget includes \\nover $62\\xa0million in support of the Association of \\nSoutheast Asian Nations (ASeAN), demonstrat -\\ning America’s continued commitment to ASeAN \\ncentrality.  The Indo-Pacific Strategy total also in -\\ncludes $2\\xa0billion to support diplomatic presence \\nand programs in the region, including new and \\nplanned U.S. diplomatic posts in the Pacific and \\nIndian Oceans.  The Budget requests $7.1\\xa0billion \\nin mandatory funding for the renewal of the \\nCompact of Free Association relationships with \\nthe Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic \\nof the Marshall Islands, and the Republic of Palau.  \\nThe Budget reflects a substantial commitment to \\nthe Indo-Pacific and relies on the $2\\xa0 billion in -\\nvestment that the Administration requested in \\nthe October 2023 national security supplemen -\\ntal request in security assistance to fully address \\nurgent regional security needs and deter acts of \\naggression.  \\nProvides Lifesaving Humanitarian \\nAssistance and Combats Global Food \\nInsecurity.   The Budget provides $10.3\\xa0 billion \\nin lifesaving humanitarian and refugee assis -\\ntance to support more than 330 million people in \\nneed in more than 70 countries, in addition to the \\nOctober 2023 emergency supplemental request \\nof $10\\xa0 billion to address unprecedented global \\nhumanitarian needs.  The Budget also fully sup -\\nports the President’s commitment to resettle \\nup to 125,000 refugees in the United States, as \\nwell as the enduring Welcome and Safe Mobility \\nOffice initiatives.  The Budget also provides more \\nthan $1\\xa0billion to support the President’s pledge \\nto alleviate global food insecurity, including \\n$100\\xa0million for the Vision for Adapted Crops and \\nSoils, as part of the overall U.S. Government’s \\nflagship food security initiative, Feed the Future, 44 INVeSTING IN AMeRICA AND THe AMeRICAN PeOPLe\\nwhich works to build more resilient and sus -\\ntainable food systems and nutritious food crops \\nin underserved regions.

The \\nBudget supports the President’s goal to strength -\\nen American development efforts through local \\nexpertise and by deploying a more expansive set \\nof development tools.  The Budget provides over \\n$3\\xa0billion for bolstering global democracy, includ -\\ning $345\\xa0million for the President’s Initiative for \\nDemocratic Renewal to foster transparent and \\naccountable governance.  The Budget provides \\nmore than $3\\xa0 billion to advance gender equity \\nand equality worldwide, including $200\\xa0 million \\nfor the Gender equity and equality Action Fund.  \\nThe Budget also includes $110\\xa0million in support \\nof internet freedom, including $50\\xa0million for the \\nU.S. Agency for Global Media Open Technology \\nFund.  The Budget provides $594\\xa0million, an in -\\ncrease of $37\\xa0 million above the 2023 level, for \\nUSAID directed high-impact and lifesaving vol -\\nuntary family planning and reproductive health programs and America’s voluntary contribution \\nto the United Nations Population Fund.  The \\nBudget continues America’s commitment to con -\\ntributions for the United Nations.\\nFulfills the President’s Commitment to \\nCentral America and Strengthens America’s \\nPartnership in the Western Hemisphere.   \\nThe Budget provides approximately $1\\xa0 billion \\nfor Central American programming to meet the \\nPresident’s commitment to invest $4\\xa0 billion in \\nCentral America over four years to address the \\nroot causes of migration.  The Budget also sup -\\nports hemispheric programs to advance econom -\\nic prosperity and regional security through key \\ninitiatives such as the Americas Partnership for \\neconomic Prosperity, including $75\\xa0million for a \\ncapital increase to the Inter-American Investment \\nCorporation—known as IDB Invest—to advance \\nclean energy projects, modernize agriculture, \\nstrengthen transportation systems, and expand \\naccess to financing.  The Budget further re -\\nserves $35\\xa0million in additional targeted funding \\nfor regional migration management, including \\n$25\\xa0million for the IDB’s Migration Grant Facility \\nto support integration efforts for migrants and \\nhost communities and address the root causes of \\nirregular migration.\\nCUTTING THE DEFICIT BY EXPANDING AMERICA’S PRODUCTIVE \\nCAPACITY AND PROMOTING TAX FAIRNESS\\nFrom day one, the Biden-Harris Administration \\nhas worked to build an economy from the middle \\nout and bottom up.  The President’s economic \\nagenda has shown that investing in the Nation \\ncan go along with achieving meaningful deficit re -\\nduction.  The deficit is over $1 trillion lower than \\nwhen the President took office, thanks in large \\npart to a strong economic recovery facilitated by \\ninvestments that have expanded the Nation’s pro -\\nductive capacity and a historic vaccination pro -\\ngram that allowed the responsible wind-down of \\nemergency measures.  In addition, the President \\nhas also signed into law significant pro-growth \\ninvestments and deficit-reduction policies that are already lowering costs for families and rein -\\nvigorating American industry and will continue \\nto take full effect in coming years. \\nDelivering on a Commitment \\nto Fiscal Responsibility.  \\nThe President has enacted another rough -\\nly $1 trillion in savings over the next decade \\nthrough the FRA, and through the Inflation \\nReduction Act provisions that empower Medicare \\nto negotiate lower prescription drug prices, cap \\ninsulin at $35 per month for seniors,\\xa0and make BUDGeT OF THe U. S. GOVeRNMeNT FOR FISCAL YeAR 2025 45\\nthe wealthy and large corporations pay more of \\ntheir fair share.  To address the unfairness of 55 \\nof the most profitable U.S. corporations paying \\n$0 in Federal income taxes, the President signed \\ninto law a 15-percent minimum tax on the prof -\\nits of the largest corporations—those with over \\n$1\\xa0 billion in profits.  He also signed into law a \\nsurcharge on corporate stock buybacks, which \\nencourages businesses to invest in their growth \\nand productivity as opposed to funneling tax-\\npreferred profits to wealthy shareholders.  The \\nInflation Reduction Act also enacted long-overdue \\ninvestments in rebuilding and modernizing the \\nInternal Revenue Service (IRS), which raise rev -\\nenue by making wealthy taxpayers and big corpo -\\nrations pay the taxes they owe—while improving \\ncustomer service and without increasing audit \\nrates relative to historical levels for small busi -\\nnesses and taxpayers making under $400,000 per \\nyear.  The Budget would build on this progress by \\nincreasing the corporate minimum tax rate to 21 \\npercent, quadrupling the surcharge on stock buy -\\nbacks, extending the IRS investment, and other \\nimportant reforms.\\nAs these investments continue to deliver \\nfor working families and communities, the \\nAdministration looks forward to building on this \\nprogress with responsible investments that con -\\ntinue to grow America’s economy from the middle \\nout and bottom up while improving the long-term \\nbudget outlook.  The Budget proposes another \\n$3 trillion in deficit reduction over the next 10 \\nyears by making the wealthy and large corpora -\\ntions pay their fair share, closing tax loopholes, \\ncutting wasteful spending on Big Pharma, Big \\nOil, and other special interests.\\nIn addition to Medicare tax and prescription \\ndrug reforms discussed above, the Budget: \\nProposes a Minimum Tax on Billionaires.   \\nThe tax code currently offers special treatment \\nfor the types of income that wealthy people en -\\njoy.  While the wages and salaries that everyday \\nAmericans earn are taxed as ordinary income, \\nbillionaires make their money in ways that are \\ntaxed at lower rates, and sometimes not taxed \\nat all.  This special treatment, combined with sophisticated tax planning and giant loopholes, \\nallows many of the wealthiest Americans to pay \\nlower rates on their full income than many mid -\\ndle-class households pay.  To finally address this \\nglaring inequity, the Budget includes a 25 per -\\ncent minimum tax on the wealthiest 0.01 percent, \\nthose with wealth of more than $100\\xa0million. \\nEnsures Corporations Pay Their Fair \\nShare.   The Budget increases the rates that corpo -\\nrations pay in taxes on their profits.  Corporations \\nreceived an enormous tax break in 2017, cutting \\neffective U.S. tax rates for U.S. corporations to a \\nlow of less than 10 percent.  While their profits \\nsoared, their investment in their workers and the \\neconomy did not.  Their shareholders and top ex -\\necutives reaped the benefits, without the prom -\\nised trickle down to workers, consumers, or com -\\nmunities.  The Budget would set the corporate \\ntax rate at 28 percent, still well below the 35 per -\\ncent rate that prevailed prior to the 2017 tax law.  \\nIn addition, the Budget would raise the Inflation \\nReduction Act’s corporate minimum tax rate on \\nbillion-dollar corporations from 15 percent to 21 \\npercent, ensuring the biggest corporations pay \\nmore of their fair share.  These policies are com -\\nplemented by other proposals to incentivize job \\ncreation and investment in the United States and \\nensure large corporations pay their fair share.\\nDenies Corporations Deductions for \\nAll Compensation Over $1\\xa0 million Per \\nEmployee.   executive compensation has sky -\\nrocketed in recent decades, with Chief executive \\nOfficer pay averaging more than 300 times that \\nof a typical worker in 2022.  The 2017 tax law’s \\ncorporate tax cuts only made this problem worse, \\nproducing massive boosts to executive compen -\\nsation while doing nothing for low- and middle-\\nincome workers.  Current law denies deductions \\nfor executive compensation over $1\\xa0million only \\nfor a small number of highly paid employees at \\npublicly-traded C corporations.  The Budget pro -\\nposes to deny deductions for all compensation \\nover $1\\xa0million paid to any employee of a C corpo -\\nration, which would discourage companies from \\ngiving their executives massive pay packages and \\nlevel the playing field across C corporations. 46 INVeSTING IN AMeRICA AND THe AMeRICAN PeOPLe\\nStops the Race to the Bottom in \\nInternational Corporate Tax and Ends Tax \\nBreaks for Offshoring.   For decades, countries \\nhave competed for multinational business by \\nslashing tax rates, at the expense of having ad -\\nequate revenues to finance core services.  Thanks \\nin part to the Administration’s leadership, more \\nthan 130 nations signed on to a global tax frame -\\nwork to finally address this race to the bottom in \\n2021.  Many of America’s international partners, \\nincluding many of the world’s largest economies, \\nhave implemented or will soon implement this \\ntransformational agreement.  The Budget propos -\\nes to do the same by reforming the international \\ntax system to reduce the incentives to book prof -\\nits in low-tax jurisdictions, stopping corporate in -\\nversions to tax havens, and raising the tax rate \\non U.S. multinationals’ foreign earnings from \\n10.5 percent to 21 percent.  These reforms would \\nensure that profitable multinational corporations \\npay their fair share. \\nQuadruples the Stock Buybacks Tax.   In \\n2022, the President signed into law a surcharge \\non corporate stock buybacks, which reduces the \\ntax advantage for buybacks over dividends and \\nencourages businesses to invest in their growth \\nand productivity as opposed to funneling tax-\\npreferred profits to foreign shareholders.  The \\nBudget proposes quadrupling the stock buybacks \\ntax from one percent to four percent to address \\nthe continued tax advantage for buybacks and \\nencourage corporations to invest in productivity \\nand the broader economy. \\nRepeals Tax Cuts for the Wealthy and \\nReforms Capital Gains Tax to Ensure the \\nWealthy Pay Their Fair Share.   The 2017 tax \\nlaw lowered rates for the wealthiest Americans, \\ndelivering massive tax cuts to the top one per -\\ncent.  The Budget repeals those cuts, restoring \\nthe top tax rate of 39.6 percent for single filers \\nmaking more than $400,000 a year and married \\ncouples making more than $450,000 per year.  \\nThe Budget also proposes taxing capital gains \\nat the same rate as wage income for those with \\nmore than $1\\xa0million in income and finally closes \\nthe carried interest loophole that allows some wealthy investment fund managers to pay tax at \\nlower rates than their secretaries. \\nCloses Tax Loopholes.   The Budget saves bil -\\nlions of dollars by closing other tax loopholes that \\noverwhelmingly benefit the rich and the largest, \\nmost profitable corporations.  This includes:  clos -\\ning the so-called “like-kind exchange loophole” \\nthat lets real estate investors defer tax indefinite -\\nly; reforms to tax preferred retirement incentives \\nto ensure that the ultrawealthy cannot use these \\nincentives to amass tax free fortunes; prevent -\\ning the super-wealthy from abusing life insur -\\nance tax shelters; closing a loophole that benefits \\nwealthy crypto investors; and ending a tax break \\nfor corporate jets.   \\nCracks Down on Wealthy Tax Cheats.   The \\nInflation Reduction Act addressed long-standing \\nIRS funding deficiencies by providing stable, \\nmulti-year funding to improve tax compliance by \\nfinally cracking down on high-income individuals \\nand corporations who too often avoided paying \\ntheir lawfully owed taxes and improve service for \\nthe millions of Americans that do pay their taxes.  \\nAlready, the IRS is using these resources to crack \\ndown on tax evasion by the wealthy and big busi -\\nnesses.  For example, the IRS is collecting taxes \\nowed by tax-delinquent millionaires and address -\\ning complex tax schemes used by the largest part -\\nnerships and multinational corporations, along \\nwith improving customer service and moderniz -\\ning IT infrastructure.  The Budget proposes to re -\\nstore the full Inflation Reduction Act investment \\nand provide new funding over the long-term to \\ncontinue cutting the deficit by making sure that \\nwealthy Americans and big corporations pay the \\ntaxes they owe.  \\nAddresses Expiring Tax Cuts after 2025.   \\nPresident Trump and congressional Republicans \\ndeliberately sunset portions of the Tax Cuts and \\nJobs Act of 2017 legislation after 2025 to con -\\nceal both the true increase in the deficit—much \\nlarger than the already-massive $2\\xa0 trillion cost \\nestimate—and the true size of their tax breaks \\nfor multi-millionaires and large corporations.  \\nThis was one of the most egregious and fiscally \\nreckless budget decisions in modern history.  The BUDGeT OF THe U. S. GOVeRNMeNT FOR FISCAL YeAR 2025 47\\nPresident, faced with this fiscally irresponsible \\nlegacy, will work with the Congress to address the \\n2025 expirations, and focus tax policy on reward -\\ning work not wealth, based on the following guid -\\ning principles.  The President: \\n• Opposes increasing taxes on people earn -\\ning less than $400,000 and supports \\ncutting taxes for working people and \\nfamilies with children to give them more \\nbreathing room;\\n• Opposes tax cuts for the wealthy—either \\nextending tax cuts for the top two percent of Americans earning over $400,000 or \\nbringing back deductions and other tax \\nbreaks for these households; and\\n• Supports paying for extending tax cuts for \\npeople earning less than $400,000 with \\nadditional reforms to ensure that wealthy \\npeople and big corporations pay their fair \\nshare, so that the problematic sunsets \\ncreated by President Trump and congres -\\nsional Republicans are addressed in a \\nfiscally responsible manner.49CREATING A GOVERNMENT THAT DELIVERS \\nFOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE\\nTo build on the historic progress made under \\nPresident Biden’s leadership, the American peo -\\nple need a modern and effective Government.  A \\nhigh-performing Federal Government—staffed \\nby expert civil servants—plays a critical role in \\nensuring Americans have reliable services and \\nresources, from helping the American people file \\ntaxes and apply for benefits, to confronting the \\nrisks and opportunities presented by artificial \\nintelligence (AI).\\nTo help deliver that future, the President’s \\nBudget advances the goals of the Biden-Harris \\nManagement Agenda (PMA) across three key ar -\\neas:  strengthening and empowering the Federal \\nworkforce; delivering excellent, equitable, and \\nsecure Federal services and customer experi -\\nence; and managing the business of Government.  \\nThis work is critical for bolstering Government’s \\nability to deliver for the American people.\\nThe Right Team and the Right Tools\\nMore than four million Americans serve the \\nNation, as civilian and uniformed personnel, \\nboth at home and overseas.  As the Nation’s larg -\\nest employer, the Federal Government is stra -\\ntegically competing for highly-skilled talent to \\ncontinue carrying out programs and delivering \\nservices that benefit the American people.  These \\ncivil servants need to be equipped with the right \\ntools to do their jobs, including modern infor -\\nmation technology (IT).  The Budget continues \\ninvestments to ensure the Federal Government \\nhas the right team and tools to deliver for the \\nAmerican people.Helping Agencies Attract, Retain, and \\nHire Top Talent.   Agencies have made sub -\\nstantial progress in strengthening and empow -\\nering the Federal workforce, such as recruiting \\nthe wide-range of talent necessary for the im -\\nplementation of the Bipartisan Infrastructure \\nLaw, a once in a generation investment in the \\nNation’s infrastructure and competitiveness \\nthat spurred a surge hiring effort of 6,099 target -\\ned positions.  The Budget continues to support \\nOffice of Personnel Management’s (OPM) pro -\\ngrams—such as the Hiring experience Office—\\nin making progress on streamlining hiring.  The \\nBudget also directs agencies to take part in col -\\nlaborative cross-Government shared hiring ac -\\ntions that enable agencies to quickly hire on a \\nlarger scale, allowing applicants to submit one \\nFederal job application and be considered for \\nmany opportunities.  The Budget advances the \\nAdministration’s focus on the expansion of early \\ncareer talent pipelines, including the develop -\\nment of strategic and targeted apprenticeships, \\nincreased volume of student and early career op -\\nportunities, and equitable access to paid intern -\\nships.  The Budget also provides resources to \\nsupport continued transformation of the person -\\nnel vetting mission, and its Trusted Workforce \\n2.0 Implementation Strategy, which is designed \\nto ensure all Americans can trust the Federal \\nworkforce. \\nBuilding the Personnel System and \\nSupport Required to Make the Federal \\nGovernment a Model Employer.   As the \\nGovernment faces increasingly complex chal -\\nlenges, the need for Federal leaders, managers, \\nand front-line staff with the right skills in the \\nright jobs has never been greater.  The Budget 50 CReATING A GOVeRNMeNT THAT DeLIVeRS FOR THe AMeRICAN PeOPLe\\nsustains critical investments in OPM to en -\\nable the Agency’s ability to lead Federal human \\ncapital management and serve as a centralized \\nleader in human resources.  The Budget further \\nadvances work to address Government-wide com -\\npensation challenges, and reinforces additional \\ninitiatives to enhance personnel systems for criti -\\ncal elements of the workforce. \\nModernizing Federal IT Policies and \\nTechnology to Better Serve the American \\nPeople.  Technology is a key enabler for the \\nFederal Government and its workforce.  The \\nBudget makes key investments to protect the \\nFederal systems from compromises—leverag -\\ning the benefits of digital identity and AI while \\nbalancing the risks it poses to rights, opportuni -\\nties, and safety, and redefining security expecta -\\ntions for software and the cloud.  To support IT \\nmodernization efforts, the Budget also includes \\nan additional $75 million for the Technology \\nModernization Fund (TMF), an innovative in -\\nvestment program that gives agencies additional \\nways to deliver services to the American public \\nquickly.  TMF manages over $750 million for \\n48\\xa0investments, across 27 Federal agencies, and \\nis particularly well-positioned to make a large \\nimpact in the Federal Government’s ability to de -\\nliver excellent, equitable, and secure services.\\nAdvancing AI Governance, Innovation, \\nand Risk Management.  To capitalize on the \\nopportunities and mitigate the risks of AI—in -\\ncluding by implementing Section 10 of executive \\nOrder 14110, “Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy \\nDevelopment and Use of Artificial Intelligence,”—\\nthe Administration is committed to advancing \\nits management of AI and significantly expand -\\ning AI talent in the Federal Government.  The \\nBudget provides additional funding for Federal \\nagencies to establish agency Chief AI Officers ac -\\ncountable for their agency’s use of AI, to adopt \\nnew AI technologies to improve Government ser -\\nvices, and to establish minimum safeguards for \\nGovernment use of AI to protect the rights and \\nsafety of the public.  In addition to this funding, \\nthe Budget also includes an additional $32 mil -\\nlion for the U.S. Digital Service (USDS), General \\nServices Administration, and OPM to support the National AI Talent Surge across the Federal \\nGovernment.\\nServing the American People\\nPresident Biden set an objective in the PMA \\nthat when the American public interacts with \\nGovernment, they should get a simple, seamless, \\nand secure customer experience that is on par \\nwith what they expect in the private sector.  The \\nBudget advances this goal by: \\nSupporting Digital Services Teams.   The \\nBudget sustains investment in the USDS to con -\\ntinue bringing world class technology talent into \\nthe Federal Government—helping agencies con -\\nfront some of their hardest issues.  USDS staff \\nare centrally recruited into the Government from \\nthe private sector and deployed into agencies to \\nassist with the critical projects, buttressing exist -\\ning personnel with new skills and expertise.  Over \\nthe past 10 years, USDS has successfully helped \\nagencies to modernize their technical operations \\nand minimize the risk of large IT projects, over 60 \\npercent of which have historically failed without \\nthe intervention of USDS.  For example, USDS \\nis supporting the Internal Revenue Service in its \\ntechnology transformation, modernizing decades-\\nold systems and improving taxpayer services, \\nthe Department of Health and Human Service \\n(HHS) in streamlining the enrollment and re -\\nnewal process for Medicaid coverage, including \\nsaving half a million children from erroneously \\nlosing their health insurance, and the Federal \\nCommunications Commission in its efforts to \\nbring affordable, reliable, and high-speed broad -\\nband to eligible households.\\nIncreasing Customer Experience Across \\nthe Federal Government.   The Budget funds \\nthe expertise and tools necessary to ensure ex -\\ncellent service delivery and customer experience \\nacross the Federal Government.  The Budget \\ninvests in teams of specialized customer expe -\\nrience and digital services professionals in 10 \\nFederal departments, and critical subagencies \\nthat serve millions of customers.  The Budget \\nalso provides funding for new “Voice of Customer” BUDGeT OF THe U. S. GOVeRNMeNT FOR FISCAL YeAR 2025 51\\nprograms at eight Federal agencies to collect and \\nreport performance data on key drivers of cus -\\ntomer experience from a broad representation of \\nAmericans— which can drive meaningful service \\nimprovements.  The Budget also supports spe -\\ncific service delivery enhancements, such as the \\nTransportation Security Administration’s pilot \\nprogram to deploy customer experience strate -\\ngists at airports to streamline passenger screen -\\ning, and the Department of State’s efforts to build \\nonline passport renewal.\\nDesigning, Building, and Managing \\nGovernment Service Delivery for Priority \\nLife Experiences.   The Budget advances efforts \\nto better serve the American people by providing \\nfunding for interagency teams to build digital \\nservice capacity.  Following extensive customer \\nexperience-focused discovery research and design \\nphase projects and pilots aimed at developing \\npromising solutions, the Budget also specifical -\\nly supports cross-agency Life experience proj -\\nects, including funding for the Health Resources \\nand Services Administration at HHS to help \\nAmericans more easily access essential services \\nfollowing the birth of a child.  In addition, the \\nBudget invests in shared products and platforms \\nthat enable simple, seamless, and secure services \\nacross the Federal Government.  \\nProtecting Taxpayer Investment\\nThe Administration has the obligation to invest \\ntaxpayer money with care, ensuring that taxpay -\\ners get excellent returns on each dollar that is \\nspent.  That includes investing in American work -\\ners, small businesses, equity efforts, and climate \\nresilience.  The Budget invests in improved stew -\\nardship of taxpayer funds in the following ways: \\nEnsuring the Future is Made in America.   \\nThe President’s economic agenda is focused on \\nensuring the future is made in America.  The \\nAdministration is delivering on the President’s \\nagenda by advancing a whole-of-Government ef -\\nfort to ensure resources and programs advance \\ndomestic jobs and industries.  The Bipartisan \\nInfrastructure Law included the Build America, Buy America Act, requiring that all federally \\nfunded infrastructure projects use American iron \\nand steel, manufactured products, and construc -\\ntion materials, unless such items are not avail -\\nable, would constitute an unreasonable cost, or \\nmeet the requirements of other statutory exemp -\\ntions.  The Office of Management and Budget’s \\n(OMB) Made in America Office is working with \\nFederal agencies to improve their capacity to \\nperform supply chain analysis, perform market \\nresearch, and engage with industry to maximize \\nthe use of critical domestic products.  These ef -\\nforts will help to strengthen the U.S. industrial \\nbase in critical sectors while increasing the qual -\\nity and number of good-paying jobs by promoting \\nthe domestic production of steel and iron prod -\\nucts, manufactured products, and construction \\nmaterials.\\nStreamlining Federal Grant-Making and \\nImproving Program Outcomes.   In order to \\nreduce administrative burden for Federal agen -\\ncies and recipients and to improve outcomes of \\nFederal financial assistance programs, OMB is \\nupdating its comprehensive Guidance on Grants \\nand Agreements.  These updates will represent \\nthe most substantial changes to the guidance \\nsince its release in 2013, and will reduce unnec -\\nessary compliance requirements.  In addition, \\nto improve the coordination of Federal financial \\nassistance policy, oversight, and strategic direc -\\ntion, OMB established the Council on Federal \\nFinancial Assistance in August 2023.  This part -\\nnership of Federal grant-making agencies pro -\\nvides a single forum for oversight and manage -\\nment of Federal financial assistance. \\nImproving Federal Procurement.   Under \\nthe Better Contracting Initiative, agencies will \\nensure strong contracting outcomes by mak -\\ning better use of acquisition data and leverag -\\ning expertise in acquiring common software and \\nother IT requirements.  At the same time, the \\nAdministration is working aggressively to cre -\\nate a more resilient supplier base and increase \\ncompetition by increasing the percent of Federal \\ncontract award dollars that go to small disad -\\nvantaged businesses—building on historic spend \\nmade by agencies to this underserved community 52 CReATING A GOVeRNMeNT THAT DeLIVeRS FOR THe AMeRICAN PeOPLe\\non the way to a goal of 15 percent by 2025.  In ad -\\ndition, agencies will advance the sustainability of \\nFederal supply chains and achieve net-zero emis -\\nsions from Federal procurement by 2050.\\xa0\\nManaging the Government to Deliver \\nResults that Improve Lives.  The \\nAdministration continues to drive evidence-based \\nmanagement practices to deliver a more effective \\nGovernment.  OMB and agency leadership con -\\nducted strategic review meetings to review prog -\\nress on agency strategic plans and discuss ap -\\nproaches to strengthening organizational health \\nand organizational performance, following the re -\\nlease of OMB Memorandum M-23-15, Measuring, \\nMonitoring, and Improving Organizational \\nHealth and Organizational Performance in the \\nContext of evolving Agency Work environments.  \\nIn December of 2023, agencies established 79 \\nnew performance commitments to be achieved \\nthrough 2025.  The public is invited to follow \\nagency progress on  https: //Performance.gov . \\nAdvancing Federal Evidence-Based \\nPolicymaking.  The President has made clear \\nthat the Administration will make decisions guid -\\ned by the best available science and data.  The \\nBudget demonstrates this commitment by invest -\\ning in evidence-based programs at, and bolster -\\ning capacity for, program evaluation.  The Budget \\ninvests in the Federal statistical system’s key role \\nin evidence building by expanding skilled statis -\\nticians and infrastructure to equip agencies with \\ntools for ensuring high-quality data and robust \\ndata confidentiality protections, as well as creat -\\ning a seamless data user experience.\\nPromoting Accountability and Integrity.  \\nThe Administration is committed to improving \\nprogram integrity and ensuring effective stew -\\nardship of taxpayer dollars, including through \\nimplementation of the American Rescue Plan, the \\nBipartisan Infrastructure Law, the CHIPS and \\nScience Act, and the Inflation Reduction Act.  To \\ndeliver on those commitments, the Administration \\nhas provided agencies with the tools to strength -\\nen program integrity and deliver results.  The \\nPresident has made clear that results, transpar -\\nency, and accountability go hand-in-hand, which is why the Budget includes robust legislative and \\nfunding proposals that would ensure agencies and \\ntheir Inspectors General have the resources and \\nauthorities they need for appropriate oversight \\nof these programs.  For example, the Budget in -\\ncludes new proposals for modernizing, protecting, \\nand strengthening the Unemployment Insurance \\n(UI) program that would help states develop and \\ntest fraud-prevention tools and strategies and \\nincrease investigations of fraud rings targeting \\nthe UI program.  Further, the Budget ensures \\nadditional resources and time for investigations \\nand prosecution of those engaged in major or sys -\\ntemic pandemic fraud, invests in identity theft \\nand fraud prevention to stop fraud before funds \\nare ever paid out, and provides much-needed help \\nfor innocent victims recovering from having their \\nidentities and benefits stolen.\\nBolstering Federal Cybersecurity.   To pro -\\ntect against foreign adversaries and safeguard \\nFederal systems, the Budget bolsters cyberse -\\ncurity by ensuring every agency is increasing \\nthe security of public services.  To advance the \\nAdministration’s commitment to making cyber -\\nspace more resilient and defensible, the Budget \\nprovides $13 billion in cybersecurity funding \\nacross civilian departments and agencies.  In addi -\\ntion, the Budget provides an additional $103\\xa0mil -\\nlion for the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure \\nSecurity Agency (CISA), for a total of $3 billion \\nto advance the Administration’s commitment to \\nmaking cyberspace more resilient and defensible.  \\nThis includes:  $470 million to deploy Federal \\nnetwork tools, including endpoint detection and \\nresponse capabilities; $394 million for CISA’s in -\\nternal cybersecurity and analytical capabilities; \\n$41 million for critical infrastructure security \\ncoordination, and $116 million for critical infra -\\nstructure cyber event reporting.\\nTransforming Personnel Vetting.   The \\nAdministration is committed to improving how \\nagencies vet their civilian, military, and contrac -\\ntor personnel—to ensure Government is employ -\\ning personnel with necessary skillsets.  During \\n2023, the Administration sustained reform mo -\\nmentum by rolling out new training standards for \\nthe background investigators and adjudicators BUDGeT OF THe U. S. GOVeRNMeNT FOR FISCAL YeAR 2025 53\\nimplementing policy changes, authorizing the \\nexpansion of continuous vetting beyond national \\nsecurity sensitive personnel, and transitioning \\naway from legacy e-QIP software to the more \\nuser-friendly eApp platform for individuals en -\\ntering the personnel vetting process.  The Budget \\ninstructs agencies to be prepared for further \\nimprovements as directed in the Performance \\nAccountability Council’s Trusted Workforce 2.0 Implementation Strategy.  Among other goals, \\nagencies should expect to continue enrolling their \\nnon-sensitive personnel into continuous vetting, \\nexpand data collection for enhanced performance \\nmetrics, update training and internal processes \\nto reflect reform progress, and adopt additional \\npersonnel vetting shared services. 55DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE\\nThe President’s 2025 Budget:  \\n• Lowers Energy Costs and Catalyzes Clean Energy and Economic Growth in Rural \\nCommunities.  The Budget builds on the $13 billion provided in the President’s historic \\nInflation Reduction Act for rural development programs at USDA to reduce energy bills for \\nfamilies, expand clean energy, transform rural power production, and create thousands of \\ngood-paying jobs for people across rural America.  Rural communities are critical to achiev -\\ning the goal of 100 percent clean electricity by 2035.  The Budget provides $1\\xa0billion for loan \\nguarantees for renewable energy systems and energy efficiency improvements for farmers \\nand rural small businesses, and $6.5 billion in authority for rural electric loans to support \\nadditional clean energy, energy storage, and transmission projects that would create good-\\npaying jobs.  In addition, the Budget includes $53 million in zero-interest loans for the Rural \\nenergy Savings Program, which would help rural Americans implement durable cost-effec -\\ntive energy efficiency measures in their homes, which lowers energy costs and contributes \\nto the President’s clean energy goals and the Justice40 Initiative.  The Budget also provides \\n$10 million in Rural Community Facilities Grants specifically for rural communities making \\nan energy transition away from outdated energy sources, facilitating emerging infrastruc -\\nture needs.\\n• Connects More Rural Americans to High-Speed, Affordable, and Reliable Internet.   \\nThe President is committed to ensuring that every American has access to affordable broad -\\nband internet—and thanks to his Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, under the Biden-Harris The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) is responsible for providing nutrition assistance to \\nlow-income Americans and a safety net for the farm sector, conserving and preserving private \\nagricultural lands, and sustaining the health and productivity of the Nation’s forests.  The \\nPresident’s 2025 Budget for USDA:  sustains America’s advantages in agriculture; strengthens \\nthe nutrition safety net and removes barriers to vital assistance; promotes job growth and \\neconomic opportunity in rural communities, including more jobs in clean energy to mitigate \\nthe effects of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions; promotes environmental justice; supports \\nhistorically disadvantaged and underserved producers; and helps farmers, ranchers, and forest \\nlandowners adapt to the effects of the climate crisis.\\nThe Budget requests $29.2 billion in discretionary budget authority for 2025, a $2 billion or \\n7.4-percent increase from the 2023 level, excluding Food for Peace Title II Grants, which are \\nincluded in the State and International Programs total.  Resources provided through the 2025 \\nBudget complement investments in natural resource conservation, national forest and wildland \\nfire management, and broadband deployment provided in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and \\nInflation Reduction Act.  56 DePARTMeNT OF AGRICULTURe\\nAdministration, USDA has provided $2.3 billion to people living and working across 35 States \\nand Territories, which is expected to expand broadband access to more than 137,000 house -\\nholds.  Installing high-speed internet creates high-paying union jobs and strengthens rural \\neconomies, which leads to higher property values, increased job and population growth, lower \\nunemployment rates, and new business formation.  Reliable internet is also crucial for ru -\\nral Americans to access healthcare services through telehealth.  Building on the $2 billion \\nfor USDA broadband programs provided in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law for 2023, the \\nBudget provides $112 million for the ReConnect program, which provides grants and loans to \\ndeploy broadband to unserved areas, especially tribal areas. \\n• Increases Climate Resilience and Other Conservation Practices in Agriculture \\nProduction.   Climate change presents real threats to U.S. agricultural production, forest re -\\nsources, and rural communities.  The Budget provides $6 billion for climate-related funding, a \\n$733 million increase over the 2023 enacted level, and $1.3 billion over the 2020\\xa0enacted level. \\nThis funding includes $985 million for the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), \\na $67 million or 7-percent increase above the 2023 enacted level, and a $152 million increase \\nor 18-percent above the 2020 enacted level, to assist farmers, ranchers, and forestland owners \\nwith production goals in the face of a changing climate while conserving, maintaining, and \\nrestoring natural resources on their lands.   The Inflation Reduction Act provided generational \\ninvestments to increase adoption of voluntary conservation practices that sequester carbon \\nand reduce GHG emissions associated with farming and ranching operations.  Increasing \\nconservation in agricultural production supports voluntary environmental services markets, \\nleverages private-sector and other non-Federal investment, and provides additional income \\nopportunities for America’s farmers.  These practices also help producers adapt to multi-year \\ndrought conditions and reductions in water availability.  To implement Inflation Reduction \\nAct investments, the NRCS would hire thousands of employees—creating good-paying jobs \\nthroughout rural America. \\n• Supports a Strong Nutrition Safety Net.   The Budget provides $8.5 billion for critical nu -\\ntrition programs, including $7.7 billion to fully fund participation in the Special Supplemental \\nNutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), which is critical to the health of \\npregnant women, new mothers, infants, and young children.  This program helps low-income \\nfamilies put nutritious food on the table and addresses racial disparities in maternal and child \\nhealth outcomes.  In the Biden-Harris Administration National Strategy on Hunger, Nutrition, \\nand Health , the Administration set goals to help more individuals experiencing food insecurity \\naccess Federal nutrition assistance programs.  By investing in outreach and modernization, \\nWIC would reach 800,000 more women, infants, and children each month, providing vital nu -\\ntrition assistance to nearly seven million individuals, up from 6.2 million in 2021.  The Budget \\nsupports enhanced benefits for fruits and vegetables to improve nutritional outcomes and \\nreduce food insecurity among children consistent with the recommendations by the National \\nAcademies of Sciences, engineering, and Medicine.  In addition, the Budget includes an emer -\\ngency contingency fund that would provide additional resources, beyond the $7.7 billion, when \\nthere are unanticipated cost pressures.  The Budget also includes $15 billion over 10 years to \\nallow more States and schools to leverage participation in the Community eligibility Provision \\nto provide\\xa0healthy school meals at no cost to an additional nine million children.   \\n• Invests in America’s Brave Wildland Firefighters.   The Budget builds on the \\nAdministration’s historic investments in the wildland firefighting workforce at the Forest \\nService and the Department of the Interior, including investments from the Bipartisan \\nInfrastructure Law, by supporting implementation of permanent and comprehensive pay reform, BUDGeT OF THe U. S. GOVeRNMeNT FOR FISCAL YeAR 2025 57\\nenhancement of health services, hiring of additional permanent and temporary wildland fire -\\nfighters to increase capacity, and improvement of Government housing.  These investments, \\ntotaling $387 million over the comparable 2023 enacted level for USDA Forest Service, would \\nhelp address long-standing recruitment and retention challenges, increase the Departments’ \\ncapacity to complete critical risk mitigation work, and further the Administration’s commit -\\nment to build a more robust and resilient wildland firefighting workforce as the frequency and \\nintensity of catastrophic wildfires continue to increase due to climate change. \\n• Reduces Housing Insecurity and Strengthens Climate Resiliency in Rural \\nCommunities.   Adequate affordable housing has been a long-standing problem in rural \\ncommunities—one that is exacerbated by low energy efficiency of the aging housing stock, \\nmeaning higher costs to families.  To help address this, the Budget proposes additional funding \\nfor rental assistance, multifamily and single-family housing, and again proposes to eliminate \\nthe existing low-income borrower penalty that requires individuals to repay subsidy costs for \\nSingle-Family Direct loans—a requirement that only exists for rural housing.  The Budget \\nprovides strong support for USDA’s multifamily housing and housing preservation programs.  \\nThrough these investments, the Administration advances equity in support of underserved \\ncommunities by reducing rent burdens for low-income borrowers and preserving low-income \\ntenant-based housing in rural America.  The Budget again proposes to increase the resiliency \\nof rural housing to the impacts of climate change through a proposal to require energy and \\nwater efficiency improvements and green features in USDA’s rural housing programs that \\ninclude construction. \\n• Sustains American Leadership in Agricultural Innovation and Research.   The Budget \\nsustains American innovation in agriculture by providing a total of almost $3.8\\xa0billion for ag -\\nricultural research, education, and outreach.  This includes $365 million, a 20-percent increase \\nabove the 2023 enacted level, for agriculture research, extension, and education grants to \\nminority-serving land grant universities and tribal colleges to increase the productive capac -\\nity of small family farms and historically underserved populations, including the responsible \\napplication of artificial intelligence to ensure that the entire spectrum of the agriculture sector \\ncan reap the economic benefits of this technology.  The Budget also includes support for the \\nduties of a Chief Artificial Intelligence Officer, who would promote the safe and responsible \\napplication of artificial intelligence in advancing the productivity of the Nation’s agriculture \\nsector.  The Budget provides $321 million for the Department’s core climate-related research \\nand development (R&D) activities, which includes R&D on the carbon cycle and the impacts \\nof weather and water cycle variations on soil, air, and water resources associated with agri -\\nculture.  This would help to quantify risks and benefits to agriculture from global change so \\ntechnologies can be developed for harnessing beneficial aspects of global change, adapting \\nagricultural systems to change, and mitigating the Nation’s net emissions of GHG. \\n• Provides Trade and International Food Security.   America’s farmers, ranchers, and \\nproducers are feeding the world.  The Budget provides funding to fully staff the Foreign \\nAgricultural Service, which supports the marketing and promotion of high-quality, high-value \\nU.S. agricultural products to a variety of overseas markets, creating jobs and income streams \\nthroughout the supply chain domestically and internationally.  Further, the Budget allows \\nfor USDA to engage in international trade and regulatory systems and agreements, creating \\nnew markets and ensuring current markets stay open.  In addition, the Budget provides food \\nassistance, such as $243 million for the McGovern-Dole International Food for education and \\nChild Nutrition Program.  Lastly, capacity building projects, supported by the Budget, combat \\nglobal food insecurity, share knowledge around climate-smart agricultural practices, and de -\\nvelop rules- and science-based markets.58 DePARTMeNT OF AGRICULTURe\\n• Supports Better Delivery of Services to Rural America and the Nation’s Farmers.   To \\nbetter serve rural communities and areas that have been previously left behind, the Budget \\nprovides funding for USDA to ensure adequate staffing and critical information technol -\\nogy upgrades to improve program delivery.  This includes expanding the authority for the \\nNon-recurring expenses Fund to access expired discretionary funds for projects that would re -\\nmediate cybersecurity vulnerabilities and improve web-based rural development loan services \\nto provide a more automated experience for borrowers.  To make sure that eligible individuals \\nare aware of available Federal support, regardless of their native language, the Budget pro -\\nvides $2 million for a Department-wide Language Access Plan.  To expand rural prosperity \\nand economic growth, the Budget includes $10 million for the Rural Partners Network, which \\ncontinues the collaboration and outreach of 20 Federal agencies and regional commissions to \\nensure rural communities have equitable access to Federal programs.  \\n• Supports the Upcoming Farm Bill.   The Budget provides USDA with the staffing resources \\nnecessary to seamlessly implement reauthorization of the Farm Bill.  The Administration looks \\nforward to working this year with the Congress, partners, stakeholders, and the public to iden -\\ntify shared priorities and build on the historic legislative achievements of the first three years \\nof the Administration.  The Farm Bill presents a unique opportunity to transform the food and \\nagricultural system from one that benefits a few to one that benefits many—all while strength -\\nening USDA’s nutrition programs, which are among the most effective and far-reaching tools \\navailable to improve the health and well-being of Americans.  The Nation can achieve mean -\\ningful, equitable growth in agriculture and rural economies by creating new revenue streams \\nfor American farmers, ranchers, and producers of all sizes through climate smart agriculture \\nand forestry, biobased products, renewable energy, local and regional food systems, increased \\ncompetition in agricultural markets, and other value-added opportunities, while reducing the \\npaperwork burden for Federal programs and achieving best in Government practices.  The Farm \\nBill is also a critical opportunity to ensure that the wealth created in rural America stays there \\nto empower rural communities with the tools necessary to advance their locally-led vision.  \\n \\nThe upcoming Farm Bill is also an opportunity to make progress toward ensuring that all \\nAmericans have access to healthy, affordable food, as emphasized in the Biden-Harris \\nAdministration National Strategy on Hunger, Nutrition, and Health .  This is an important \\nmoment to protect food assistance benefits that reflect the true cost of a basic, healthy diet, \\nstrengthen cross enrollment capabilities across Federal assistance programs, and eliminate \\nbarriers to food assistance for vulnerable groups.  These barriers make it difficult for un -\\nderserved groups to succeed, including low-income college students, individuals reentering \\nsociety and seeking a second chance, youth who have aged out of foster care, kinship fami -\\nlies, low-income individuals in the U.S. Territories, and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance \\nProgram (SNAP) recipients facing time limits.  Rather than reducing obstacles to employ -\\nment, research demonstrates that time limits on SNAP eligibility amplify existing inequities \\nin food and economic security.  Beyond removing barriers to food access, there is also the \\nopportunity to make healthier choices easier by expanding food purchasing options, fruit \\nand vegetable incentives, and local food procurement through Federal nutrition programs, \\nincluding by building upon efforts already plotted by USDA.  The Farm Bill reauthorization \\nprocess is an opportunity to strengthen program integrity to address new risks and vulnera -\\nbilities while ensuring that USDA can continue to support the needs of all eligible households.  \\n \\nThe Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to:  support new and beginning \\nfarmers; shore up the Federal Government’s commitment to agricultural research; address \\nclimate change by protecting and enhancing investments in conservation, climate-smart BUDGeT OF THe U. S. GOVeRNMeNT FOR FISCAL YeAR 2025 59\\nagriculture and forestry, and clean energy; strengthen local and regional food supply chains; con -\\ntinue efforts on reducing food loss and waste; support competition by increasing transparency \\nand continuing to support small and independent processors; open new market opportunities \\nand provide a competitive advantage for American producers—including small and histori -\\ncally underserved producers and early adopters.  In addition, the Administration supports \\nimprovements to crop insurance, proactively managing risk from natural hazards, including \\nthe permanent authorization of the cover crop incentive program.  These Administration pri -\\norities can help create a stronger safety net and better markets for consumers and producers \\nof U.S. agricultural products through the Farm Bill, which is one piece of the puzzle for how \\nUSDA helps people across America and the globe. 61DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE\\nThe President’s 2025 Budget:  \\n• Fosters Economic Development and Creates Good-Paying Jobs.

In \\nOctober 2023, the Administration submitted an emergency national security supplemental \\nrequest to the Congress for urgent security needs through the end of 2024.  This request in -\\ncluded $58 billion for DOD to provide critical support to Israel and Ukraine, and to strengthen \\nintegrated deterrence in the Indo-Pacific.  The request would also make crucial investments in \\nthe American DIB, benefitting U.S. military readiness and helping to create and sustain jobs \\nacross America.  Absent congressional action on this emergency request, DOD would not be \\nable to provide this urgently needed support to its allies and partners, or to make these criti -\\ncal DIB investments.  The Administration appreciates the bipartisan supplemental legislation \\nthat passed the Senate that would address these urgent needs.69DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION\\nThe President’s 2025 Budget:  \\nPreschool to 12th Grade Education \\n• Supports Academic Achievement for All Students, Particularly Students in Schools \\nwith High Rates of Poverty.   The disruptive effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on student \\nlearning has added new urgency to the work of schools.  The Budget includes $8 billion in \\nmandatory funding to provide Academic Acceleration and Achievement Grants to close op -\\nportunity and achievement gaps and speed the pace of learning recovery.  Carrying forward \\nefforts funded by the American Rescue Plan, these grants to school districts would support \\nevidence-based strategies to increase school attendance, provide high-quality tutoring, and \\nexpand learning time, including both in the summer and in extended day or afterschool pro -\\ngrams.  To help ensure that every student receives the high-quality education they deserve, \\nthe Budget also provides $18.6 billion for Title I, a $200 million increase above the 2023 \\nenacted level.  This funding amount is $2.1 billion higher than when the President took of -\\nfice, reflecting the President’s strong commitment to expanding support for every American \\nstudent.  Title I, which reaches 90 percent of school districts across the Nation, delivers criti -\\ncal funding to schools in low-income communities so they can provide their students with the \\nlearning opportunities needed to recover academically from the COVID-19 pandemic and be \\nsuccessful after graduation.  \\n• Expands Access to High-Quality Preschool.   The Budget includes a major new manda -\\ntory funding proposal for a Federal-State partnership to provide free, high-quality preschool \\nto four-year olds, offered in the setting of a parent’s choice—from public schools to child care \\nproviders to Head Start.  The proposal gives States the flexibility to expand preschool to \\nthree-year-old children once they make high-quality preschool fully available to four-year-old \\nchildren.  Over the next 10 years, this proposal would dramatically expand access to effec -\\ntive early childhood education, ensuring students enter kindergarten ready to learn.  This The Department of Education (ED) is responsible for assisting States, school districts, and \\ninstitutions of higher education in providing a high-quality education to all students and \\naddressing the inequitable barriers underserved students face in education.  The President’s \\n2025 Budget for ED makes critical investments to:  spur the Nation’s future prosperity; accelerate \\nacademic growth; bolster mental health supports for students at all levels; advance the needs \\nof students with disabilities; increase affordability and quality in higher education; and improve \\nconnections between the K-12 system, higher education, and the workforce.\\nThe Budget requests $82 billion in discretionary funding for ED in 2025, a $3.1 billion or \\n3.9-percent increase from the 2023 level.70 DePARTMeNT OF eDUCATION\\nproposal would be administered by the Department of Health and Human Services in col -\\nlaboration with eD.  The Budget also includes $25 million for incentive demonstration grants \\nto create or expand free, high-quality preschool in school or community-based settings for \\nchildren eligible to attend Title I schools.  The incentive demonstration grants, which would \\nrequire close collaboration among school districts, Head Start, and other community-based \\nproviders, would serve as models that could be adopted across the Nation.  This program would \\nexpand its reach by encouraging districts to leverage Title I funds, along with other Federal, \\nState, and local funds.\\n• Bolsters Mental Health Supports for All Students.  The mental health of students, teach -\\ners, and school staff is essential for their overall well-being and continued academic recovery, \\nand continues to be a high priority of the Administration, which has delivered an additional \\n$2.1 billion to mental health programs since 2021.  Research shows that students who receive \\nsocial, emotional, mental, and behavioral supports have better outcomes, including performing \\nbetter academically.  The Budget provides a combined total of $216 million for mental health \\nprograms, including $200 million from the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, a 900-percent \\nincrease in program funding since 2021.  These funds would help increase the number of \\nschool-based counselors, psychologists, social workers, and other mental health professionals \\nin K-12 schools. \\n• Addresses Critical Educator Shortages.  While the education sector has faced shortages \\nin critical staffing areas for decades, these shortages have grown worse since the COVID-19 \\npandemic, highlighting the importance of retaining educators and building strong pipelines \\ninto the profession.  Since 2021, the Administration has supported schools in addressing ed -\\nucator shortages, including by supporting the expansion of evidence-based pathways such \\nas residencies and grow your own programs, which may be provided through teacher regis -\\ntered apprenticeships.  The Budget includes $90 million for Supporting effective education \\nDevelopment, $95 million for the Teacher Quality Partnership program, and $30 million for \\nthe Hawkins Centers of excellence program, to expand the number of prospective teachers \\nwho have access to comprehensive, high-quality pathways and improve the diversity of the \\nteacher pipeline.  The Budget also includes critical investments in recruitment and retention \\nof teachers and school leaders, and provides $173 million for the Teacher and School Leader \\nIncentive Fund.\\n• Increases Support for Children with Disabilities.  To support high-quality special edu -\\ncation services for over seven million Pre-K through 12 students with disabilities, the Budget \\nprovides $14.4 billion for Individuals with Disabilities education Act (IDeA) State Grants, a \\n$200 million increase over the 2023 enacted level.  Since 2021, the Administration has secured \\na $1.3 billion, or 10-percent, increase in annual funding for the program as well as an addition -\\nal $2.6 billion in American Rescue Plan funds to help students with disabilities recover from \\nthe COVID-19 pandemic.  The Budget also invests $545 million in IDeA Grants for Infants \\nand Families, to provide early intervention services to infants and toddlers with disabilities.  \\nTo address nationwide special educator shortages, the Budget also invests $125 million, which \\nis $10 million above the 2023 enacted level, in grants to prepare special education and early \\nintervention personnel—addressing another critical educator shortage area.\\n• Expands Full-Service Community Schools.  Community schools continue to be a high \\npriority for the Administration as they play a critical role in providing comprehensive wrap-\\naround services to students and their families, including afterschool programs, adult education \\nopportunities, and health and nutrition services, and have been demonstrated to improve aca -\\ndemic and other outcomes for students.  The Budget provides $200 million for this program, BUDGeT OF THe U. S. GOVeRNMeNT FOR FISCAL YeAR 2025 71\\nan increase of $50 million above the 2023 enacted level, and a 500-percent, or $120 million, \\nincrease in program funding since the beginning of the Administration. \\n• Supports Multilingual Learners.  The number of students learning english as a second \\nlanguage continues to grow in the Nation’s schools, and multilingualism is a crucial skill \\nthat all students should develop to be competitive in a global economy.  The Budget provides \\n$940 million for the english Language Acquisition program, an increase of $50 million above \\nthe 2023 enacted level, to help students learning english attain english proficiency and achieve \\nacademic success.  The Budget provides $72 million in dedicated funding to help schools hire \\nmore bilingual teachers and allow States and districts to provide professional development on \\nmultilingual education for existing teachers and staff.\\nEducation Beyond High School \\n• Improves College Affordability and Provides Free Community College.   To help low-\\nand middle-income students overcome financial barriers to postsecondary education, the \\nBudget proposes to increase the discretionary maximum Pell Grant by $100 and thereby \\nexpand the reach of the program to over 7.2 million students.  The Budget builds on success -\\nful bipartisan efforts to increase the maximum Pell Grant award by $900 over the past two \\nyears—the largest increase in more than 10 years.  The Budget provides a path to double \\nthe maximum award by 2029 for students attending public and non-profit institutions.  The \\nBudget excludes for-profit institutions from the mandatory increases due to evidence these in -\\nstitutions are least likely to provide good outcomes for students.  The Budget also expands free \\ncommunity college across the Nation through a Federal-State partnership.  In addition, the \\nBudget provides two years of subsidized tuition for students from families earning less than \\n$125,000 enrolled in a four-year Historically Black College and University (HBCU), Tribally \\nControlled College and University (TCCU), or Minority-Serving Institution (MSI). \\n• Invests in Services for Student Borrowers.  The Budget provides $2.7 billion for the \\nOffice of Federal Student Aid (FSA), a $625 million increase above the 2023 enacted level.  This \\nadditional funding is needed to provide better support to the 46 million student loan borrowers \\nand make additional and necessary improvements to the new servicing system.  This increase \\nwould allow FSA to continue to modernize its digital infrastructure and ensure the success -\\nful administration of its financial aid programs, including the Free Application for Federal \\nStudent Aid, through a simplified and streamlined process for students and borrowers. \\n• Reduces College Costs for Students.  High college prices deter many young people from at -\\ntending the colleges that would be best for them.  The Budget includes a $12 billion mandatory \\nReducing the Costs of College Fund that would fund three strategies to lower college costs for \\nstudents.  First, the fund would provide competitive awards for public institutions that afford -\\nably deliver a quality education, allowing those schools to use those funds either to serve more \\nstudents or to share best practices so that other schools can become more affordable.  Second, \\nthe Classroom to Career fund would also provide over $7 billion for States to provide access to \\nat least 12 credits of transferable career-connected dual enrollment credits to students while \\nin high school—credits that can enable students to obtain postsecondary degrees more afford -\\nably.  Third, the fund would support evidence-based strategies, such as the City University of \\nNew York’s Accelerated Study in Associate Programs model, which increase college graduation \\nrates, reduce cost burdens for students, and lower costs per graduate.  \\n• Eliminates the Origination Fee on Student Loans.  The Budget builds on the President’s \\nhistoric actions to reduce student debt and the cost of college by eliminating the origination 72 DePARTMeNT OF eDUCATION\\nfees charged to borrowers on every new Federal student loan.  These unnecessary fees burden \\nanyone who needs to borrow to help get an education and cost American families billions of \\ndollars.\\n• Reimagines the Transition from High School to Higher Education.  Reimagining tra -\\nditional educational pathways to higher education is critical to improving outcomes for all \\nstudents.  The Budget doubles the funding provided in 2023 for national activities in career \\nand technical education, including a focus on the Career-Connected High Schools initiative, \\nwhich seeks to increase the integration and alignment of the last two years of high school \\nand the first two years of higher education by expanding access to dual enrollment programs, \\nwork-based learning, college and career advising, and the opportunity to earn industry-recog -\\nnized credentials while in high school.\\n• Supports Students through Graduation.   The Budget supports strategies to improve the \\nenrollment, retention, transfer, and completion rates of students by investing in the Federal \\nTRIO Programs and Gaining early Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate Programs, \\nand by more than doubling funding for the Postsecondary Student Success Grants Program.  \\nThe Budget also promotes student success through investments to support students’ basic \\nneeds, including funding to help students access non-student aid public benefits and to provide \\naffordable child care for low-income student parents.\\n• Expands Institutional Capacity at HBCUs, TCCUs, MSIs—including Hispanic \\nServing Institutions (HSIs)—and Community Colleges.  The Budget increases institu -\\ntional capacity at HBCUs, TCCUs, MSIs—including HSIs—and under-resourced institutions, \\nincluding community colleges, by providing an increase of $93 million above the 2023 enacted \\nlevel.  The Budget funding level is $329 million higher than the 2021 enacted level, underscor -\\ning the President’s commitment to increasing funding to historically under-served institutions.  \\nThe Budget also doubles funding by providing $100 million for four-year HBCUs, TCCUs, and \\nMSIs to expand research and development infrastructure at these institutions, a program the \\nPresident has championed since his first year in office to address historic disparities in Federal \\nresearch and development funding to HBCUs, TCCUs, and MSIs. \\nOther Key Priorities\\n• Strengthens Civil Rights Enforcement.   The Budget provides $162 million to eD’s Office \\nfor Civil Rights (OCR), a $22 million increase above the 2023 enacted level.  This funding \\nwould ensure that OCR has the personnel it needs to carry out its mission to protect equal ac -\\ncess to education through the vigorous enforcement of civil rights laws.\\n• Advances Opportunities and Manages Risks of Artificial Intelligence (AI).   AI has \\nthe potential to provide transformational academic programming and career opportunities for \\nthe Nation’s students, but it also poses significant risks to the privacy, opportunity, and well-\\nbeing of students and educators.  To support implementation of executive Order 14410, “Safe, \\nSecure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence,” the Budget includes \\nadditional resources to enhance the capacity of Department staff, schools, and postsecondary \\ninstitutions to achieve the promise of AI while managing inherent risks.73DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY\\nThe President’s 2025 Budget:  \\n• Creates Jobs by Building Clean Energy Infrastructure and Lowers Energy Prices \\nfor American Families.   The Budget provides $1.6 billion for DOe, more than double the \\n2021 enacted level and 29 percent above the 2023 enacted level, to support clean energy \\nworkforce and infrastructure projects across the Nation, including:  $385 million to weath -\\nerize and retrofit homes of low-income Americans; $95 million, $73 million above the 2021 \\nenacted level, to electrify tribal homes, provide technical assistance to advance tribal energy \\nprojects, and transition tribal colleges and universities to renewable energy; $113 million for \\nthe Office of Manufacturing and energy Supply Chains to strengthen domestic clean energy \\nsupply chains; and $102 million to support utilities and State and local governments in build -\\ning a grid that is more secure, reliable, resilient, and able to integrate electricity from clean \\nenergy sources.  These investments, which complement and bolster the historic funding in \\nthe Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and Inflation Reduction Act, create good-paying jobs while \\ndriving progress toward the Administration’s climate goals, including producing carbon pollu -\\ntion-free electricity by 2035.  The Budget also provides dedicated funding for the Interagency \\nWorking Group on Coal and Power Plant Communities and economic Revitalization to fa -\\ncilitate a whole-of-Government approach to workforce training, community engagement, \\nand identification of Federal resources to spur economic revitalization in hard-hit energy \\ncommunities that have powered the Nation for generations.  In addition to building clean en -\\nergy infrastructure, the Budget also assumes enactment of the Administration’s request for \\n$300 million in supplemental funding for 2024 to safeguard the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, \\nwhich is a critical energy security asset that has historically protected American consumers \\nin times of emergency oil shortages.\\n• Advances Critical Climate Goals.   The Budget includes $10.6 billion in DOe climate and \\nclean energy research, development, demonstration, and deployment programs, an increase of \\n12 percent above the 2023 enacted level.  Notably, these investments include over $1 billion to The Department of Energy (DOE) is responsible for supporting the Nation’s prosperity by \\naddressing its climate, energy, environmental, and nuclear security challenges through \\ntransformative science and technology solutions.  The President’s 2025 Budget for DOE builds \\non the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Inflation Reduction Act; invests in innovation for the \\nenergy economy; advances basic research and scientific infrastructure; creates jobs building \\nclean energy infrastructure; supports the Nation’s energy and environmental justice goals; and \\nmodernizes and ensures the safety and security of the nuclear weapons stockpile. \\nThe Budget requests $51 billion in discretionary budget authority for 2025, a $3.6 billion or 7.5- \\npercent increase from the 2023 level.74 DePARTMeNT OF eNeRGY\\nimprove technologies to reduce pollution from industrial facilities, nearly $900 million to com -\\nmercialize technologies like sustainable aviation fuel and zero-emission trucks to reduce \\nemissions from the transportation sector, and over $2.4 billion in clean energy research and \\ndevelopment to improve carbon-free electricity generation, transmission, distribution, and stor -\\nage technologies for reliability, resilience, and decarbonization.  Specifically, within the Office \\nof energy efficiency and Renewable energy, the Budget includes $502 million for the Vehicle \\nTechnologies Office, $280 million for the Bioenergy—including Sustainable Aviation Fuel—\\nTechnologies Office, $318 million for the Solar energy Technologies Office, $199 million for the \\nWind energy Technologies Office, $179 million for the Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Technologies \\nOffice, and over $500 million for the Advanced Materials and Manufacturing Office and the \\nIndustrial efficiency and Decarbonization Office.  In addition, the Budget invests in advanc -\\ning climate modeling within the Biological and environmental Research program in the Office \\nof Science.  Overall, this funding advances efforts crucial for achieving the goal of a 50- to \\n52-percent reduction from 2005 levels of economy-wide net greenhouse gas pollution in 2030 \\nand economy-wide net-zero emissions no later than 2050, while also reducing energy bills for \\nAmerican families.\\n• Builds the Clean Energy Innovation Pipeline.   The Budget includes $8.5 billion across \\nDOe to support researchers and entrepreneurs transforming innovations into commercial \\nclean energy products, including in areas such as:  offshore wind; industrial heat; sustainable \\naviation fuel; and grid infrastructure.  Across DOe, the Budget provides $325 million to sup -\\nport the research, development, and demonstration of technologies and processes to increase \\nthe domestic supply of sustainable critical minerals and materials essential for several clean \\nenergy technologies.  The Budget supports $76 million to advance technologies that can enable \\nearlier detection of methane leaks and integrate across a network of methane monitoring sen -\\nsors for more reliable measurement and mitigation and $150 million to make small quantities \\nof high-assay, low-enriched uranium (HALeU) available for ongoing advanced nuclear reac -\\ntor demonstrations.  The Budget also assumes enactment of the Administration’s request for \\n$2.2 billion in 2024 supplemental funding to procure low-enriched uranium (LeU) and HALeU, \\nwhich—coupled with a long-term ban on imports of LeU and HALeU from Russia—would \\nprompt sufficient private sector investment to reinvigorate U.S. uranium enrichment and re -\\nduce America’s current dependence on Russian imports for roughly 20 percent of LeU used \\nin civilian nuclear power reactors.  The $8.5 billion also includes $845 million, an $81 million \\nincrease above the 2023 enacted level, for a Department-wide initiative to accelerate the viabil -\\nity of commercial fusion energy, coordinating academia, national laboratories, and the private \\nsector, which supports the Bold Decadal Vision for Commercial Fusion energy.  The Budget \\nfunds eight crosscutting DOe energy earthshots initiatives which could substantially reduce \\nthe cost of energy for the American consumer through innovations in clean energy generation, \\nenergy efficiency, and storage.  In addition, the Budget provides $30 million to accelerate com -\\nmercial demonstration projects through a new national laboratory effort. \\n• Reduces Health and Environmental Hazards for At-Risk Communities.   The Budget \\nprovides $8.2 billion to address legacy waste and contamination in communities used during \\nthe Manhattan Project and the Cold War for nuclear weapons production, including $3.1 billion \\nto continue cleanup progress at the Hanford site in Washington.  The Budget also supports \\n$205 million to ensure cleanup remedies at Cold War sites remain protective of human health \\nand the environment.  The Administration would ensure the investments for the cleanup of \\nlegacy pollution and long-term stewardship of these sites align with the Justice40 Initiative to \\nbenefit disadvantaged communities.BUDGeT OF THe U. S. GOVeRNMeNT FOR FISCAL YeAR 2025 75\\n• Advances Energy Justice and Equity.   The Budget supports several key initiatives to \\naccelerate equity and justice for historically excluded communities to benefit all Americans, \\nincluding:  $55 million for Community Capacity Building grants to address areas impact -\\ned by persistent poverty around DOe sites; $105 million to plan, design, and demonstrate \\ncommunity-scale energy solutions to mitigate extreme heat in low-income and disadvantaged \\ncommunities; and $256 million to build capacity for advancing energy research and develop -\\ning a new energy workforce through programs at Historically Black Colleges and Universities, \\nMinority Serving Institutions, tribal colleges, community colleges, and emerging research in -\\nstitutions.  The Budget also supports systematic implementation of the Justice40 Initiative \\nand the Department’s equity action plan strategies.  \\n• Maintains World Leading Research through the CHIPS and Science Act and Invests \\nin Climate Innovation.   The Budget invests $8.6 billion for the Office of Science to boost \\nAmerican innovation and sustain American leadership in research and scientific discovery, \\nadvancing toward the CHIPS and Science Act full authorization level.  These investments sup -\\nport:  cutting-edge research at the national laboratories and universities as well as building \\nand operating world-class scientific user facilities; identifying and accelerating novel technolo -\\ngies for clean energy solutions; improving predictability of climate trends and extremes using \\nhigh performance computing; providing new computing insight through quantum information; \\nand positioning the United States to meet the demand for isotopes.  The Budget also assumes \\nenactment of the Administration’s request for $98 million in 2024 supplemental funding for \\nincreased domestic operational capacity for development and production of isotopes.  This \\nfunding would decrease U.S. dependence on a foreign supply chain for isotopes which are \\ncritical for the public health, energy, and national security sectors and would increase U.S. \\ncompetitiveness in the global market for isotopes.\\n• Strengthens Artificial Intelligence (AI), Cybersecurity, and Resilience of the Energy \\nSector.   The Budget provides $455 million to extend the frontiers of AI for science and tech -\\nnology and to increase AI’s safety, security, and resilience.  These investments enhance the \\nDepartment’s computing capabilities and support the development of AI testbeds to build \\nfoundation models for energy security, national security, and climate resilience as well as tools \\nto evaluate AI capabilities to generate outputs that may represent nuclear, nonproliferation, \\nbiological, chemical, critical-infrastructure, and energy security threats or hazards.  The fund -\\ning also invests in continued support for training new researchers from a diverse array of \\nbackgrounds capable of meeting the rising demand for AI talent.  \\n• Protects the Nation from Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) Terrorism.   The Budget \\nenhances DOe capabilities to prevent and respond to WMD terrorist attacks by non-state ac -\\ntors at home and abroad.  The Budget also supports DOe’s long-standing efforts to advance \\nnuclear and radioactive material security, enhancing U.S. national security, health, and eco -\\nnomic interests.  In addition, the Budget continues investments to develop the next generation \\nof arms control technologies and experts to help mitigate against emerging and evolving na -\\ntional security risks.\\n• Strengthens the Nation’s Nuclear Deterrent.  The Budget provides $19.8 billion for \\nWeapons Activities, $4.5 billion above the 2021 enacted level, to prioritize implementation of \\nthe 2022 National Defense Strategy  and Nuclear Posture Review by modernizing the Nation’s \\nnuclear deterrent to keep the American people safe.  The Budget supports a safe, secure, reli -\\nable, and effective nuclear stockpile and a resilient, responsive nuclear security enterprise \\nnecessary to protect the U.S. homeland and allies from growing international threats.76 DePARTMeNT OF eNeRGY\\n• Powers the Nuclear Navy.   DOe’s Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program ensures safe and \\nreliable operation of reactor plants in nuclear-powered submarines and aircraft carriers.  The \\nBudget prioritizes infrastructure modernization and investments to develop, refine, and de -\\nliver new technologies to the Navy and maintain America’s advantage over its adversaries.77DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES\\nThe President’s 2025 Budget:  \\nReduces Drug and Other Healthcare Costs for All Americans\\n• Negotiates Lower Drug Prices and Expands Access to Prescription Drugs.  Thanks \\nto action taken by this Administration, millions of seniors are saving money on their drug \\ncosts, and the Administration announced the first 10 drugs for which prices will be negoti -\\nated by Medicare as it continues implementation of the Inflation Reduction Act.  The Budget \\nbuilds on this success by:  significantly increasing the pace of negotiation; bringing more \\ndrugs into negotiation sooner after they launch; expanding the Inflation Reduction Act’s in -\\nflation rebates and $2,000 out-of-pocket prescription drug cost cap beyond Medicare and into \\nthe commercial market; and by taking other steps to build on the Inflation Reduction Act drug \\nprovisions.  In addition, the Budget extends the $35 cost-sharing cap for a month’s supply of \\na covered insulin product to the commercial market.  For Medicaid, the Budget includes pro -\\nposals to ensure Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) are prudent \\npurchasers of prescription drugs, such as authorizing HHS to negotiate supplemental drug \\nrebates on behalf of interested States in order to pool purchasing power.  The Budget also \\nlimits Medicare Part D cost-sharing for high-value generic drugs, such as those used to treat \\nhypertension and hyperlipidemia, to no more than $2 for Medicare beneficiaries.  To speed \\ndevelopment and increase access of safe and affordable biosimilar medicines, the Budget \\nstreamlines and modernizes the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) premarket review.\\n• Expands Access to Quality, Affordable Healthcare.   The President and Vice President \\nbelieve that healthcare is a right, not a privilege.  With enrollment in marketplace coverage \\nat an all-time high, the Budget builds on the incredible success of the Affordable Care Act by \\nmaking permanent the expanded premium tax credits that the Inflation Reduction Act ex -\\ntended and providing Medicaid-like coverage to individuals in States that have not adopted The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is responsible for protecting the health \\nand well-being of Americans through its research, public health, and social services programs.  \\nThe President’s 2025 Budget for HHS:  expands access to quality, affordable healthcare while \\nlowering costs; dramatically improves access to early care and learning; advances the Biden \\nCancer Moonshot; transforms behavioral healthcare; enhances public health infrastructure and \\ncapabilities to improve health outcomes; bolsters maternal health; advances health equity; and \\ntransforms child welfare.\\nThe Budget requests $130.7 billion in discretionary budget authority for 2025, a $2.2 billion or \\n1.7-percent increase from the 2023 level.  This request includes appropriations for the 21st \\nCentury Cures Act and the program integrity cap adjustment.78 DePARTMeNT OF HeALTH AND HUMAN SeRVICeS\\nMedicaid expansion, paired with financial incentives to ensure States maintain their existing \\nexpansions.  Further, the Budget includes an allowance to ban unwarranted “facility fees” for \\ntelehealth and certain outpatient services in commercial insurance.  The Budget also includes \\nfunding for continued implementation of the No Surprises Act, which protects Americans across \\nthe Nation from surprise medical bills.  For Medicaid and CHIP, the Budget allows States to \\nextend the existing 12-month continuous eligibility for all children to 36 months, and allows \\nStates to provide continuous eligibility for children from birth until they turn age six.  Further, \\nthe Budget prohibits enrollment fees and premiums in CHIP.  The President also supports \\neliminating Medicaid funding caps for Puerto Rico and other Territories while aligning their \\nmatching rate with States and moving toward parity for other critical Federal programs in -\\ncluding Supplemental Security Income and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.\\nHonors America’s Commitment to Seniors and Americans in Need\\n• Protects and Strengthens Medicare and Medicaid.  The Budget extends solvency of the \\nMedicare Hospital Insurance (HI) trust fund indefinitely by ensuring that high-income indi -\\nviduals contribute their fair share and directing revenue from the Net Investment Income Tax \\ninto the HI trust fund as was originally intended.  In addition, the Budget directs an amount \\nequivalent to the savings from the Budget’s proposed Medicare drug reforms into the HI trust \\nfund.  The Budget proposes to limit the portion of Medicaid and CHIP managed care dollars \\nspent on administration and incentivize more investments in quality healthcare services by \\nestablishing a medical loss ratio.\\n• Protects Seniors’ Health and Dignity.   The Budget invests $150 billion over 10 years to \\nimprove and expand Medicaid home and community-based services, which allow older adults \\nand individuals with disabilities to remain in their homes and stay active in their communi -\\nties, and improve the quality of jobs for home care workers.  In addition, the Budget proposes \\nto shift funding for nursing home surveys from discretionary to mandatory beginning in 2026, \\nand increase funding to cover 100 percent of statutorily-mandated surveys, which would guard \\nagainst negligent care and ensure that Americans receive high-quality, safe services within \\nthe facilities.  The Budget also continues to build on the President’s commitment to protect \\nthe Nation’s seniors through a comprehensive agenda that:  improves the safety and quality of \\nnursing home care; addresses the backlog of complaint surveys from nursing home residents \\nand their families; expands financial penalties for underperforming facilities; requires greater \\ntransparency of nursing facility ownership; and increases the inspection of facilities with seri -\\nous safety deficiencies.\\nInvests in the Health and Well-Being of  Families and the Next Generation\\n• Strengthens Families—and the Economy—by Investing in High-Quality Child Care.   \\nFrom the beginning of this Administration, the President and Vice President have been fo -\\ncused on child care costs as a critical challenge for families.  When child care is reliable, \\nhigh-quality, and affordable, parents can make ends meet, advance in their careers, and stay \\nin the workforce.  Children benefit from early childhood experiences that support healthy child \\ndevelopment and provide opportunities to socialize with peers.  The President is committed \\nto providing relief to families and the Budget creates a historic new program under which \\nworking families with incomes up to $200,000 per year would be guaranteed affordable, high-\\nquality child care from birth until kindergarten, with most families paying no more than $10 \\na day, and the lowest income families paying nothing.  This would provide a lifeline to the par -\\nents of more than 16 million children, saving the average family over $600 per month in care \\ncosts, per child.  Parents would have the freedom to select a high-quality child care setting.  BUDGeT OF THe U. S. GOVeRNMeNT FOR FISCAL YeAR 2025 79\\nThis investment could help hundreds of thousands of women with young children enter or re-\\nenter the workforce more quickly.  The President’s Council of economic Advisers found that \\nrecent Federal investments in child care have increased labor force participation among moth -\\ners with young children by roughly three percentage points, equivalent to over 300,000 more \\nwomen in the labor force.  The President’s proposal would also ensure that early care and edu -\\ncation workers receive fair and competitive pay.  The Budget also provides $8.5 billion for the \\nChild Care and Development Block Grant, a 44-percent increase since 2021, which would con -\\ntinue to serve school-age children, while most children under age six would be served through \\nthe new program.\\n• Builds a Strong Foundation for Families with Universal Pre-K and Head Start.   The \\nBudget funds voluntary, universal, free preschool for all four million of the Nation’s four-year-\\nolds and charts a path to expand preschool to three-year-olds.  High-quality preschool would \\nbe offered in the setting of the parent’s choice—from public schools to child care providers to \\nHead Start.  In addition, the Budget increases Head Start funding by $544 million to support \\nthe Administration’s goal to reach pay parity between Head Start staff and public elementary \\nschool teachers with similar qualifications over time.  Together these proposals would support \\nhealthy child development, help children enter kindergarten ready to learn, and support fami -\\nlies by reducing their costs prior to school entry and allowing parents to work.  \\n• Supports Family Planning Services for More Americans.   Americans deserve access to \\nthe healthcare they need, including contraception and family planning services, which are es -\\nsential to ensuring control over personal decisions about their own health, lives, and families.  \\nFor more than 50 years, Title X family planning clinics have played a critical role in ensuring \\naccess to a broad range of high-quality family planning and preventive health services.  Most \\nTitle X clients live in poverty and the uninsured rate of Title X users is twice the national av -\\nerage, making the Title X family planning program a critical part of the public health safety \\nnet.  The Budget includes $390 million, a 36-percent increase above the 2023 enacted level, for \\nthe Title X Family Planning program to increase the number of patients served to 3.6 million.\\n• Reduces Home Energy and Water Costs.   The Budget provides $4.1 billion for the Low \\nIncome Home energy Assistance Program (LIHeAP).  Reducing household energy and wa -\\nter costs continues to be a priority for the Administration, as reflected in the $7 billion in \\nadditional funding the Administration has secured for LIHeAP since 2021.  LIHeAP helps \\nfamilies access home energy and weatherization assistance—vital tools for protecting vul -\\nnerable families’ health in response to extreme weather and climate change.  As part of the \\nJustice40 Initiative, HHS plans to continue its efforts to prevent energy shutoffs and increase \\nsupport for households with young children and older people, especially those that have high \\nenergy burdens.  The Budget also proposes to expand LIHeAP to advance the goals of both \\nLIHeAP and the Low Income Household Water Assistance Program. Specifically, the Budget \\ngives States the option to use a portion of their LIHeAP funds to provide water bill assistance \\nto low-income households.\\n• Advances Child and Family Well-Being in the Child Welfare System.  With the overarch -\\ning goal of keeping families safely together, reducing the number of children entering foster \\ncare, and achieving better outcomes for children, the Budget proposes to expand and incentiv -\\nize the use of evidence-based foster care prevention services.  The Budget provides States with \\nsupport and incentives to place more foster children with relatives or other adults who have an \\nexisting emotional bond with the children instead of in group homes and institutions, and pro -\\nvides additional funding to support youth who age out of care without a permanent caregiver.  \\nThe Budget proposes to nearly double flexible funding for States through the Promoting Safe 80 DePARTMeNT OF HeALTH AND HUMAN SeRVICeS\\nand Stable Families Program, and proposes new provisions to expand access to legal represen -\\ntation for children and families in the child welfare system.  The Budget provides competitive \\ngrants for States and localities to advance reforms that would reduce the overrepresentation \\nof children and families of color in the child welfare system and address the disparate experi -\\nences and outcomes of these families.  The Budget also respects the rights of Lesbian, Gay, \\nBisexual, Transgender, Queer, and Intersex individuals and provides more families with the \\nsupport they need to remain safely together.  In addition, the Budget provides $195 million for \\nStates and community-based organizations to respond to and prevent child abuse. \\n• Supports America’s Promise to Refugees and Care for Unaccompanied Children.   \\nThe Budget builds on the Administration’s October 2023 supplemental request and provides \\n$9.3 billion for the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) to help rebuild the Nation’s refugee \\nresettlement infrastructure and support the resettling of up to 125,000 refugees in 2025.  The \\nBudget also helps ensure that unaccompanied immigrant children receive appropriate sup -\\nport and services while they are in ORR’s care and are unified with relatives and sponsors as \\nsafely and quickly as possible.  This funding would allow ORR to continue the programmatic \\nimprovements the Administration has made, including expanding access to counsel to help \\nchildren navigate complex immigration court proceedings and enhancing case management \\nand post-release services.  In addition, the Budget includes an emergency contingency fund \\nthat would provide additional resources, beyond the $9.3 billion, when there are unanticipated \\nincreases in the number of unaccompanied children.\\nTransforms Behavioral Healthcare\\n• Invests in Behavioral Healthcare.  In 2022, almost a quarter of adults suffered from men -\\ntal illness, 13 percent of adolescents had serious thoughts of suicide, and overdose deaths \\ncontinued near record highs.  As a core pillar of his Unity Agenda, the President released a \\nnational strategy to transform how to understand and address mental health in America—and \\nthe Budget makes progress on this agenda by improving access to care for individuals and \\ncommunities.  The Budget makes significant investments in expanding the 988 Suicide and \\nCrisis Lifeline that is projected to respond to 7.5 million contacts from individuals in distress \\nin 2025 alone.  In addition, the Budget:  expands mental healthcare and support services in \\nschools; expands the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) suicide prevention \\nprogram to additional States, and tribal and territorial jurisdictions; increases funding for the \\nChildren’s Mental Health Initiative by $50 million; doubles funding for the Mental Health \\nCrisis Partnership Program; and invests in strengthening the behavioral health workforce—\\nincluding integration into primary care settings.  The Budget also expands access to behavioral \\nhealth services through significant investments in Certified Community Behavioral Health \\nClinics and Community Mental Health Centers.  In addition, the Budget provides $1 billion \\nto advance health information technology adoption and engagement in interoperability for \\ncertain behavioral health providers.\\n• Expands Coverage of Behavioral Healthcare Services.  The Budget further builds on the \\nPresident’s Unity Agenda by increasing access to behavioral health services through expanded \\ncoverage.  For Medicare beneficiaries, the Budget ensures parity of coverage between behav -\\nioral and physical conditions, expands access to a broader range of behavioral health provider \\ntypes, and reduces costs for patients receiving behavioral health services.  The Budget also \\nproposes to extend incentive payment programs for Medicare providers in areas with clinician \\nshortages to a broader set of clinicians, including behavioral health clinicians.  For people with \\ncommercial insurance, the Budget expands coverage of mental health benefits and strength -\\nens the network of behavioral health providers. BUDGeT OF THe U. S. GOVeRNMeNT FOR FISCAL YeAR 2025 81\\n• Expands Access to Treatment for Substance Use Disorder.  The Administration has \\nmade historic advances in expanding access to treatment for opioid use disorder, including \\nsigning into law a bipartisan provision to expand the number of medical providers who can \\ninitiate buprenorphine treatment for opioid use disorder from 129,000 to nearly two million, \\na 15-fold increase that can expand treatment to rural and underserved areas.  Funding for \\nStates, Territories, and Tribes through the Substance Use Prevention, Treatment, and Recovery \\nServices Block Grant and the State Opioid Response grant program have grown by a combined \\nseven percent since 2021, expanding access to prevention, harm reduction, treatment, and \\nrecovery support services nationwide.  The Budget builds on these accomplishments by in -\\ncreasing funding for the State Opioid Response grant program, which has provided treatment \\nservices to over 1.2 million people and enabled States to reverse more than 500,000 overdoses \\nwith over nine million purchased overdose reversal medication kits.  The Budget also invests \\nin a new technical assistance center to strengthen health providers understanding and treat -\\nment of women’s mental health and substance use.\\nInvests in Medical Innovation, Scientific Breakthroughs, \\nand the Treatments of Tomorrow\\n• Advances Progress toward Biden Cancer Moonshot Goals.   The President and First \\nLady reignited the Biden Cancer Moonshot to mobilize a national effort to end cancer as we \\nknow it—spurring tremendous action across the Federal Government and from the public \\nand private sectors and building a strong foundation for the work ahead.  To date, the Biden \\nCancer Moonshot has announced roughly 50 new programs, policies, and resources to address \\nfive priority actions including:  improving access to cancer screening; understanding and ad -\\ndressing environmental and toxic exposures; making progress on cancer prevention; driving \\ninnovation to reach communities and individuals; and boosting support for patients, families, \\nand caregivers.  More than 100 private companies, non-profits, academic institutions, and pa -\\ntient groups have also stepped up with new actions and collaborations.  The Budget makes \\nsignificant investments to work toward the President and First Lady’s signature Biden Cancer \\nMoonshot goal of reducing the cancer death rate by at least 50 percent over the next 25 years \\nand improving the experience of people who are living with or who have survived cancer.  \\nThese include an increase of more than $2 billion across the National Cancer Institute, FDA, \\nCDC, cancer projects at the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health, and additional \\nmandatory funds for the Indian Health Service (IHS) beginning in 2026.  \\n• Closes Research Gaps in Women’s Health.   The President and the First Lady launched \\nthe first-ever White House Initiative on Women’s Health Research, recognizing that wom -\\nen have been understudied and underrepresented in health research for far too long.  The \\nInitiative is working across Government to better integrate women’s health within the Federal \\nresearch portfolio and catalyze significant private and philanthropic commitments to increase \\nfunding for women’s health research.  The Administration proposes to transform the way the \\nGovernment funds women’s health research at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), includ -\\ning by creating a new nationwide network of centers of excellence and innovation in women’s \\nhealth.  The Budget would also double existing funding for the Office of Research on Women’s \\nHealth at NIH.  These new resources would make investments that maximize the ability to \\nprevent, diagnose, and treat health conditions in women and ensure women get the answers \\nthey need when it comes to their health. 82 DePARTMeNT OF HeALTH AND HUMAN SeRVICeS\\nAdvances Health Equity\\n• Promotes Maternal Health and Health Equity.  The United States has the highest mater -\\nnal mortality rate among developed nations, and rates are disproportionately high for Black, \\nAmerican Indian and Alaska Native, and rural women.  Since 2021, funding to reduce maternal \\nmortality has grown by over $190 million, demonstrating this Administration’s commitment to \\naddressing needs in this area.  The Budget continues this progress by including $376 million, \\nan increase of $82 million above the 2023 enacted level to support the ongoing implementation \\nof the White House Blueprint for Addressing the Maternal Health Crisis , launched by the Vice \\nPresident, to reduce maternal mortality and morbidity rates, and address the highest rates of \\nperinatal health disparities.  The Budget expands Medicaid maternal health support services \\nduring the pregnancy and postpartum period by incentivizing States to reimburse a broad \\nrange of providers including doulas, community health workers, peer support initiatives, and \\nnurse home visiting programs.  In addition, the Budget builds on the success of the more than \\n40 States that answered the Vice President’s call to extend Medicaid postpartum coverage by \\nrequiring all States to provide continuous Medicaid coverage for 12 months postpartum, elimi -\\nnating gaps in health insurance at a critical time for all women. \\n• Guarantees Adequate and Stable Funding for IHS.   The Administration is committed \\nto upholding the United States’ responsibility to tribal nations by addressing the historical \\nunderfunding of IHS.  The enactment of an advance appropriation for 2024 for IHS was a \\nhistoric and welcome step toward the goal of eventually securing adequate and stable funding \\nfor IHS that will provide needed improvements in access to care and the overall health sta -\\ntus of American Indians and Alaska Natives.  The Budget requests $8 billion in discretionary \\nresources in 2025, a 12-percent increase over the 2021 enacted level.  Included increases are \\nfor clinical services, preventative health, facilities construction, contract support costs, and \\ntribal leases.  Beginning in 2026, the Budget proposes all resources as mandatory.  Mandatory \\nfunding would:  close longstanding service and facility shortfalls over time; improve access \\nto high-quality healthcare; and fund key Administration priorities, such as the Biden Cancer \\nMoonshot.  The Budget also proposes to reauthorize and increase funding for the Special \\nDiabetes Program for Indians, which has been critical in lowering the prevalence of diabetes \\nin Indian Country. \\n• Advances Rural Health.   With over 60 million Americans living in rural areas, the Budget \\ninvests in direct primary care and mental healthcare services, expanded infrastructure, and \\nassistance for rural hospitals to remain open and provide high-quality services in these critical \\ncommunities.\\nProtects and Strengthens Public Health and Health Infrastructure\\n• Helps Communities Respond to and Recover from Gun Violence.   Gun violence is a \\nsignificant public health problem in the United States and is the leading cause of death for \\nchildren and teens.  The effects of gun violence extend beyond victims and their families.  Gun \\nviolence can overwhelm communities and lead to short- and long-term needs.  The Budget \\ninvests a total of $2.5 billion in discretionary and mandatory funds over 10 years in CDC to \\nsupport an evidence-based community violence initiative.  The initiative would address the \\ncauses of violence in communities and help reduce the health inequities that characterize \\nsuch violence across the United States.  The Budget also includes $60 million for gun violence \\nresearch across CDC and NIH. \\n• Enhances Biodefense and Public Health Infrastructure.  Over the past three years, \\nsubstantial progress has been made toward developing and implementing transformational BUDGeT OF THe U. S. GOVeRNMeNT FOR FISCAL YeAR 2025 83\\ncapabilities to increase the Nation’s ability to respond to and prepare for emerging health \\nthreats.  Building upon this progress, the Budget invests $9.8 billion in both discretionary and \\nmandatory Prevention and Public Health Fund funding, an increase of $499 million over the \\n2023 enacted level, to bolster public health capacity that would enable CDC to better serve \\nand protect the American public.  These resources would continue to strengthen State, tribal, \\nlocal, and territorial health departments, enhance public health data systems and collection, \\nand improve the core immunization program.  In addition, the Budget includes $20 billion in \\nmandatory funding for HHS public health agencies in support of the Administration’s biode -\\nfense priorities as outlined in the 2022 National Biodefense Strategy and Implementation Plan \\nfor Countering Biological Threats, Enhancing Pandemic Preparedness, and Achieving Global \\nHealth Security .\\n• Strengthens Domestic Medical and Food Supply Chains.  The Administration has made \\nhistoric investments over the past three years to increase the resiliency of America’s supply \\nchains.  Using Defense Production Act authorities, HHS expanded domestic manufacturing \\ncapacity of medical countermeasures to make access to lifesaving drugs and vaccines more \\nreliable and quickly scalable to respond to future threats.  The Budget builds on this progress \\nby investing $75 million in the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response to \\nmanufacture more essential medicines, medical countermeasures, and critical inputs in the \\nUnited States and $12 million to strengthen FDA’s capacity to identify and address potential \\ndisruptions and shortage threats.  The Budget also expands end-to-end supply chain visibility \\nto priority FDA-designated essential medicines and devices to prepare for and mitigate po -\\ntential shortages.  The Budget institutionalizes HHS’s supply chain resilience and shortage \\nmitigation efforts in a new office to coordinate Department-wide activities, strategy, and guid -\\nance for drugs, biologics, medical devices, and critical foods.\\n• Invests in the Treatment and Prevention of Infectious Diseases.   The Budget invests \\nin the treatment and prevention of infectious diseases, including Hepatitis C, HIV, and vac -\\ncine-preventable diseases.  The Budget proposes a national program to significantly expand \\nscreening, testing, treatment, prevention, and monitoring of Hepatitis C infections in the \\nUnited States, with a specific focus on populations with high infection levels.  To help end the \\nHIV epidemic, the Budget eliminates barriers to accessing pre-exposure prophylaxis—also \\nknown as PreP—for Medicaid beneficiaries and proposes a new mandatory program to guar -\\nantee PreP at no cost for all uninsured and underinsured individuals and provide essential \\nwrap-around services.  The Budget also invests in State and local efforts to promote equity \\nand protect civil rights through a new initiative to modernize outdated criminal statutes with \\na discriminatory impact on HIV-positive individuals.  In addition, the Budget proposes a new \\nVaccines for Adults program to provide uninsured adults with access to routine and outbreak \\nvaccines at no cost.  The Budget also expands the Vaccines for Children (VFC) program to in -\\nclude all children under age 19 enrolled in CHIP and covers the vaccine administration fee for \\nall VFC-eligible uninsured children. \\n• Invests in Healthcare Cybersecurity.  Cyber attacks on the healthcare system disrupt \\npatient care and put patient safety at risk, and the healthcare system continues to be a target \\nfor cyber criminals.  From 2018 to 2022, there was a 95-percent increase in large data breach -\\nes reported to HHS, including ransomware attacks.  In line with the National Cybersecurity \\nStrategy , which emphasizes a whole-of-Nation approach to addressing the ongoing cyber \\nthreat, the Budget invests in protecting the Nation’s healthcare system from cyber threats.  \\nThe Budget includes funding for the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response \\nto coordinate HHS’s cybersecurity efforts.  The Budget provides $800 million to help high-\\nneed, low-resourced hospitals cover the upfront costs associated with implementing essential 84 DePARTMeNT OF HeALTH AND HUMAN SeRVICeS\\ncybersecurity practices, and $500 million for an incentive program to encourage all hospitals \\nto invest in advanced cybersecurity practices.  The Budget also provides $141 million to con -\\ntinue strengthening HHS’s ability to protect and defend HHS systems and information while \\nsupporting the Healthcare and Public Health Sector, including $11 million to expand and en -\\nhance HHS’s capacity to protect the privacy and security of health information through Health \\nInsurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 modernization.  The Budget also invests \\nin HHS’s role in promoting the use of artificial intelligence in healthcare and public health \\nwhile protecting against its risks.\\n• Modernizes Organ Donor Systems and Networks.  In 2023, the President signed into law \\nthe Securing the U.S. Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network Act to overhaul and \\nbreak up the monopoly that controlled the organ transplant system for decades.  This law will \\nhelp modernize the organ transplant system used to allocate and distribute donor organs to \\nindividuals waiting for transplants.  The Budget includes critical funding that would support \\nlifesaving reforms to the system to make it more agile, user friendly, accountable, and equi -\\ntable, resulting in increased access to donor organs.  The Budget also helps to facilitate and \\nencourage transplants for Medicare beneficiaries through expanded support for living organ \\ndonors. 85DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY\\nThe President’s 2025 Budget:  \\n• Reiterates the Administration’s Request for Immediate Funding to Secure the \\nBorder, Build Capacity to Enforce Immigration Law, and Counter Fentanyl.  In \\nOctober 2023, the Administration transmitted an emergency supplemental request for the \\nSouthwest border and migration issues totaling $11.8 billion, of which $8.7 billion was for \\nDHS.  The Budget includes, and therefore reiterates the need for, the unmet needs from the \\nOctober 2023 supplemental request.  In addition to urgent requirements, the request in -\\ncludes investments to build longer-term capacity in the areas of border security, immigration \\nenforcement, and countering fentanyl, totaling $2.9 billion for DHS.  This amount includes:  \\n$405 million to hire 1,300 additional Border Patrol Agents to secure the border; $239 million to \\nhire 1,000 additional U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Officers to stop fentanyl and \\nother contraband from entering the United States; $755 million to hire an additional 1,600 \\nAsylum Officers and support staff to facilitate timely immigration dispositions; $100 million \\nfor Homeland Security Investigations to investigate and disrupt transnational criminal or -\\nganizations and drug traffickers; and $849 million for cutting-edge detection technology at \\nports of entry.  Taken together, these long-term capacity-building investments represent the The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is responsible for:  protecting the United States \\nfrom threats and hazards by preventing terrorism; securing the Nation’s land and maritime \\nborders; enforcing U.S. immigration laws; protecting the President and other key officials; \\nsecuring Federal cyberspace and critical infrastructure; and ensuring disaster resilience, \\nresponse, and recovery.  The President’s 2025 Budget for DHS advances climate resilience, \\nFederal cybersecurity, maritime security, and humane border enforcement.  Resources in the \\n2025 Budget build on prior-year investments in the DHS workforce, cybersecurity, border security, \\nand hazard mitigation.\\nThe Budget requests $62.2 billion in discretionary budget authority for 2025, a 2-percent increase \\nabove the 2023 level, when controlling for a proposal to use a greater portion of Passenger \\nSecurity Fees to offset the Transportation Security Administration’s (TSA) topline.  The Budget \\nalso includes a proposed $4.7 billion Southwest Border Contingency Fund to respond to changing \\nconditions on the Southwest border, which, if fully accessed, would increase the DHS request to \\n10 percent above the 2023 level. \\nIn addition, the Budget includes a request for unmet needs from the Administration’s October \\n2023 border and disaster supplemental requests, including investments to build additional DHS \\nborder and immigration capacity to better address conditions at the border and counter illegal \\nfentanyl trafficking.  86 DePARTMeNT OF HOMeLAND SeCURITY\\nAdministration’s vision for ensuring the Nation’s border security and immigration system can \\neffectively respond to challenges present along the border.  In addition, the Administration ap -\\npreciates the Senate’s bipartisan border legislation that would make additional investments \\nin DHS and provide authorities to bolster the Department’s efforts to secure and manage the \\nborder. \\n• Continues to Invest in Critical Capabilities Needed for Border and Immigration \\nEnforcement.    Strengthening border security and providing safe, lawful pathways for migra -\\ntion remain top priorities for the Administration.  The Budget builds on the Administration’s \\nOctober 2023 supplemental request to include $25.9 billion for CBP and U.S. Immigration \\nand Customs enforcement (ICe), an increase of $1.9 billion over the 2023 enacted level when \\ncontrolling for border management amounts.  The Budget includes:  funds for CBP to hire an \\nadditional 350 Border Patrol Agents and 310 processing coordinators; $127 million for border \\nsecurity technology between ports of entry; and $86 million in air and maritime operational \\nsupport that is central to efforts to secure the border.  The Budget also includes:  funds to \\nsupport 34,000 ICe immigration detention beds; $225 million to address increased transporta -\\ntion and removal costs; and $34 million to combat child exploitation, forced labor, and human \\ntrafficking.\\n• Enables Resources to Scale Border Enforcement Capacity to Conditions on the \\nSouthwest Border.  Given the uncertainty surrounding border conditions in any given year, \\nthe Budget proposes a $4.7 billion contingency fund to aid the Department and its components \\nwhen responding to migration surges along the Southwest border.  Modeled on a contingency \\nfund provided for unaccompanied children, each fiscal year the fund would receive appropria -\\ntions incrementally, and above the base appropriation, as Southwest border encounters reach \\npre-identified levels.  DHS would be limited to obligating funds for surge-related functions, \\nand would transfer funds to CBP, ICe, and Federal emergency Management Agency (FeMA) \\naccounts for valid surge-related obligations.\\n• Supports Refugee Processing.   As part of the Administration’s commitment to wel -\\ncome 125,000 refugees annually, the Budget proposes $145 million for U.S. Citizenship and \\nImmigration Services (USCIS) International Refugee Affairs Division.\\n• Protects the Homeland from the Threat of Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) \\nTerrorism.   To ensure the security of the homeland from all types of terrorism threats, the \\nBudget provides $418 million for Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction (CWMD).  The \\nCWMD office works across Federal, State, local, tribal, and territorial governments and the \\nprivate sector to prevent WMD use against the homeland and promote readiness against \\nchemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear threats.  The Budget enhances the ability of \\nhigh-risk urban areas across the United States to detect and prevent terrorist attacks using \\nnuclear or other radiological material, through critical protection programs such as the Global \\nNuclear Detection Architecture, Securing the Cities, Radiation Portal Monitor Program, and \\nMobile Deployment Detection Program. \\n• Supports Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security.   To make U.S. cyberspace more \\nresilient and secure, the Budget provides $3 billion for the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure \\nSecurity Agency (CISA), an increase of $103 million over the 2023 enacted level.  This includes:  \\n$470 million to deploy Federal network tools, including endpoint detection and response capa -\\nbilities; $394 million for CISA’s internal cybersecurity and analytical capabilities; $41 million \\nfor critical infrastructure security coordination; and $116 million for critical infrastructure \\ncyber event reporting. BUDGeT OF THe U. S. GOVeRNMeNT FOR FISCAL YeAR 2025 87\\n• Deploys Artificial Intelligence (AI) Responsibly.   Recognizing that rapid advancements \\nin AI and machine learning bring with them both opportunities and the potential for misuse, \\nthe Budget includes $5 million to open an office at DHS responsible for:  coordinating the \\nDepartment’s use of AI; promoting AI innovation; and managing risks from the use of AI, \\nincluding risks to rights and safety.  Additional AI funds are also requested for existing pro -\\ngrams in ICe, CBP, and FeMA to ensure investment and expansion of the DHS AI mission, in \\nsupport of executive Order 14110,  “Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of \\nArtificial Intelligence.”\\n• Invests in Climate and Natural Disaster Resilience.   As part of the Administration’s \\nefforts to build a climate resilient Nation, the Budget provides $4.4 billion for DHS’s climate \\nresilience programs.  This is in addition to $1 billion provided by the Bipartisan Infrastructure \\nLaw for 2025.  The Budget helps State and local communities, Tribes, and Territories build \\nclimate resilience through various FeMA grant and technical assistance programs, in support \\nof the National Climate Resilience Framework .  The Budget includes $531 million for flood haz -\\nard mapping, including the development of new data to support future flood conditions so that \\ncommunities and Americans have the most up-to-date information regarding their flood risk. \\n• Supports State, Local, Tribal, Territorial, and Community Preparedness.   The \\nBudget proposes $3.2 billion for FeMA grants that support jurisdictions to prevent, protect \\nagainst, mitigate, respond to, and recover from terrorism and natural disasters.  The Budget \\nincreases funds for priority grant programs including:  $770 million for firefighter grants, \\nwhich is $50 million above the 2023 enacted level; $375 million for emergency Management \\nPerformance Grants, which is $20 million above the 2023 enacted level; and $385 million for \\nthe Nonprofit Security Grant Program, which is $80 million above the 2023 enacted level, and \\nprovides vital security assistance to threatened nonprofits, including houses of worship. \\n• Reiterates the Need for Additional Disaster Relief and Security Amounts.  In October \\n2023, the Administration transmitted an emergency supplemental request for domestic re -\\nquirements totaling $56 billion, of which $9.2 billion was for DHS.  The Budget includes, and \\ntherefore reiterates the need for, the unmet needs for FeMA from the October 2023 domestic \\nsupplemental request.  This amount includes $9 billion for the Disaster Relief Fund to address \\nongoing recovery needs in communities that have suffered major disasters, and close the gap \\nbetween disaster costs and available funding in 2024.  The Budget also reiterates the supple -\\nmental request for $200 million for FeMA’s Nonprofit Security Grant Program to support \\nnonprofit institutions at risk of terrorist attacks. \\n• Enhances America’s Presence in the Indo-Pacific Region.   Increasing America’s pres -\\nence in the Indo-Pacific region is critical to strengthening security and prosperity in Asia.  The \\nBudget includes $263 million to increase Coast Guard presence in the Indo-Pacific:  $200 million \\nto procure two additional Fast Response Cutters; and $63 million to support training, partner -\\nships, and regional engagement.  This investment contributes to:  building a more stable, free, \\nand open region with unrestricted access to the maritime commons for all nations; advancing \\nthe existing rules-based international order; and solidifying the United States as a trusted \\npartner in the region.\\n• Supports Presidential Campaign and Special Event Security.   The Budget includes \\n$2.9 billion for the Secret Service, including funds to meet both protective and investigative \\nmission requirements.  Of this amount, the Budget includes $70 million for security related to \\nthe 2024 Presidential Campaign and inauguration and $16 million to begin security prepara -\\ntions for the 2026 World Cup.  88 DePARTMeNT OF HOMeLAND SeCURITY\\n• Modernizes TSA Pay and Workforce Policies.  The TSA workforce deserves to be fair -\\nly compensated at rates comparable with their peers in the Federal workforce.  The Budget \\nincludes an additional $1.5 billion to fully fund the TSA pay equity initiative.  Since imple -\\nmenting pay parity in July 2023, TSA has already seen an 11-percent reduction in attrition, \\nand is making gains in retaining what has historically been a workforce with high turnover.89DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND \\nURBAN DEVELOPMENT\\nThe Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is responsible for creating \\nhealthy, safe, sustainable, and inclusive communities and affordable homes.  The President’s \\n2025\\xa0Budget for HUD:  protects and expands rental assistance for low-income families; provides \\nnew projects to prevent and reduce homelessness; takes steps to address affordable housing \\nsupply shortages; protects vulnerable populations from housing instability and health hazards; \\nand prevents and redresses housing-related discrimination. \\nThe Budget requests $72.6 billion in discretionary budget authority for 2025, a nearly \\n$500\\xa0million, or 0.7-percent increase from the 2023 level.  In recognition of challenges in the \\nhousing market, the Budget also includes significant mandatory and tax proposals to prioritize \\nand expand rental assistance, homeownership, and affordable and climate resilient housing \\nsupply across the Nation.  \\nThe President’s 2025 Budget:  \\n• Expands Access to Affordable Rent through the Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) \\nProgram.  The HCV program currently provides 2.3 million low-income families with rental \\nassistance to obtain housing in the private market.  The Budget proposes $32.8\\xa0billion in dis -\\ncretionary funding, an increase of $2.5 billion over the 2023 level, and assumes Public Housing \\nAgencies will draw $963 million from HCV program reserves to maintain and protect criti -\\ncal services for all currently assisted families.  The Budget also reflects the Administration’s \\ncontinued commitment to expand assistance, supporting an additional 20,000 households, \\nparticularly those who are experiencing homelessness or fleeing, or attempting to flee, domes -\\ntic violence or other forms of gender-based violence.  To further ensure that more households \\nhave access to safe and affordable housing, the Budget includes mandatory funding to sup -\\nport two populations that are particularly vulnerable to homelessness—youth aging out of \\nfoster care and extremely low-income (eLI) veterans.  The Budget provides $9 billion to \\nestablish a housing voucher program for all 20,000 youth aging out of foster care annually, \\nand provides $13 billion to incrementally expand rental assistance for 400,000 eLI veteran \\nfamilies, paving a path to guaranteed assistance for all who have served the Nation and are \\nin need.  Since the beginning of this Administration, HUD has expanded voucher assistance \\nto over 100,000 additional families, and the Budget continues this progress by expanding \\nvoucher access to hundreds of thousands of families.\\n• Increases Affordable Housing Supply to Reduce Housing Costs.   Access to safe and \\naffordable housing is a critical foundation of the President’s economic vision.  The Budget \\nbuilds on previous investments and actions by the Administration to boost housing supply 90 DePARTMeNT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DeVeLOPMeNT\\nand lower housing costs, particularly for lower- and middle-income households.  The Budget \\ninvests $1.3 billion in the HOMe Investment Partnerships Program (HOMe) to construct and \\nrehabilitate affordable rental housing and provide homeownership opportunities.  To further \\naddress the critical shortage of affordable housing in communities throughout the Nation, \\nthe Budget provides $20 billion in mandatory funding for a new Innovation Fund for Housing \\nexpansion, which would be a competitive grant program for municipalities and other entities \\nthat develop concrete plans for expanding housing supply, with additional funding for hous -\\ning affordability pilots.  The Budget also provides $7.5 billion in mandatory funding for new \\nProject-Based Rental Assistance contracts to incentivize the development of new climate-re -\\nsilient affordable housing.  The Budget expands the existing Low-Income Housing Tax Credit \\nand proposes a new Neighborhood Homes Tax Credit.  Together these proposals would expand \\nthe supply of safe and affordable housing, bring new units to market, and ultimately help curb \\ncost growth across the broader rental market.\\n• Advances Efforts to End Homelessness .  The Budget provides $4.1 billion, an increase of \\n$427 million over the 2023 level, for Homeless Assistance Grants to continue supporting ap -\\nproximately 1.2 million people experiencing homelessness each year and to expand assistance \\nto approximately 25,000 additional households, specifically survivors of domestic violence and \\nhomeless youth.  In addition, the Administration plans to use approximately $100 million \\nin program recaptures to fund coordinated interventions to support nearly 11,000 addition -\\nal homeless individuals and families.  These new resources support the Administration’s \\ncommitment to the goals laid out in the  All In:  Federal Strategic Plan to Prevent and End \\nHomelessness and build on efforts that have expanded assistance to roughly 140,000 addi -\\ntional households experiencing homelessness since the President took office.  The Budget \\nalso provides $505 million, or $6 million above the 2023 level, for Housing Opportunities for \\nPersons with AIDS, serving a population with a disproportionately high rate of homelessness \\nand providing a critical link to services.  The Budget further reflects the Administration’s com -\\nmitment to make progress toward ending homelessness by providing $8 billion in mandatory \\nfunding for the acquisition, construction, or operation of housing to expand housing options for \\npeople experiencing or at-risk of homelessness, as well as $3 billion in mandatory funding for \\ngrants to provide counseling and emergency rental assistance to older adult renters at-risk of \\nhomelessness.\\n• Supports Economic Development and Removes Barriers to Affordable Housing .  The \\nBudget provides $2.9 billion for the Community Development Block Grant program to assist \\ncommunities in modernizing infrastructure, investing in climate resilience and economic de -\\nvelopment, creating parks and other public amenities, and providing social services.  Within \\nthis amount, up to $100\\xa0million is provided to expand Pathways to Removing Obstacles to \\nHousing, a competitive program that builds upon ongoing HUD research on land use and af -\\nfordable housing by rewarding State, local, and regional jurisdictions that make progress in \\nremoving barriers to affordable housing developments, such as restrictive zoning.  States and \\nlocalities that embrace efforts to increase their supply of housing would ease cost growth for \\nrenters and homebuyers in those areas.\\n• Reduces Lead and Other Home Health Hazards for Vulnerable Families .  The Centers \\nfor Disease Control and Prevention identifies the risk for lead exposure as greatest for children \\nfrom racial and ethnic minority groups and children in families living below the poverty level.  \\nTo help protect families from these health hazards, the Budget provides $350 million for States, \\nlocal governments, and nonprofits to reduce lead-based paint and other health hazards, espe -\\ncially in the homes of low-income families with young children, as part of the Administration’s \\nJustice40 Initiative.  To more efficiently deliver assistance, the Budget transforms how States BUDGeT OF THe U. S. GOVeRNMeNT FOR FISCAL YeAR 2025 91\\nand local governments receive funds through a new formula grant program to more effectively \\nfund lead and other home health hazard mitigation efforts for the most vulnerable and at-risk \\nfamilies across the Nation.  The Budget targets $67\\xa0million specifically to prevent and mitigate \\nlead-based paint and housing-related health hazards, such as fire safety and mold, in public \\nhousing, an increase of $2 million above the 2023 level.\\n• Expands Access to Homeownership and Reduces Down Payments for First-Time \\nand First-Generation Homebuyers.   The Budget proposes a new Mortgage Relief Credit to \\nhelp increase access to affordable housing.  The proposal includes a new tax credit for middle-\\nclass homebuyers of up to $10,000 over two years to ease affordability challenges.  In addition, \\nto unlock starter home inventory for first-time homebuyers and help middle-class families \\nwho are “locked in” to their current homes because of lower mortgage rates at the time of pur -\\nchase, the proposal also includes a credit of up to $10,000 for one year to middle-class families \\nwho sell their starter home—a home at or below the area median home price—to another \\nowner-occupant.  The Budget also provides $10 billion in mandatory funding for a new First-\\nGeneration Down Payment Assistance program to help address homeownership and wealth \\ngaps.  In addition, the Budget preserves the Administration’s progress in expanding access to \\nhomeownership for underserved borrowers, including many first-time and minority homebuy -\\ners, through Federal Housing Administration (FHA) and Ginnie Mae credit guarantees.  In \\n2023, first-time homebuyers accounted for over 80 percent of FHA-insured home purchase \\nloans.  The Budget also includes up to $50 million for a HOMe down payment assistance pi -\\nlot program that would reduce mortgage down payments for first-generation as well as low \\nwealth first-time homebuyers. \\n• Supports Eviction Prevention Efforts .  The Budget provides $3 billion in mandatory fund -\\ning for competitive grants to promote and solidify State and local efforts to reform eviction \\npolicies by providing access to legal counsel, emergency rental assistance, and other forms of \\nrent relief.  The Budget also includes $10 million for the eviction Protection Grant Program, \\nwhich provides legal assistance to low-income tenants at risk of or subject to eviction.\\n• Advances Equity by Preventing and Redressing Housing Discrimination and \\nthrough Other Government-Wide Priorities .  The Budget provides $86 million, equal \\nto the 2023 level, to support State and local fair housing enforcement organizations and to \\nfurther education, outreach, and training on rights and responsibilities under Federal fair \\nhousing laws.  The Budget also preserves robust funding for HUD staffing and technical as -\\nsistance to affirmatively further fair housing, improve access to affordable housing, address \\ngender-based violence, and combat housing discrimination, including discrimination in tenant \\nand homebuyer screening and advertising in furtherance of executive Order 14110, “Safe, \\nSecure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence.” \\n• Improves the Quality of HUD-Assisted Housing .  The Budget provides $26.5 billion \\nin funding to support HUD-assisted multifamily properties and Public Housing to serve \\n2.2\\xa0million low-income families.  In addition to ongoing efforts to make HUD-assisted multi -\\nfamily housing more resilient and energy efficient—the Green and Resilient Retrofit Program, \\nthe Budget includes $112 million for preservation and greening of HUD-assisted housing via \\nthe Rental Assistance Demonstration.  The Budget also centralizes funding for inspections for \\nthese properties, which would enhance HUD’s ability to identify and address financial and \\nphysical risks and would complement HUD’s modernized National Standards for Physical \\nInspection of Real estate building maintenance standards.  To further complement these ef -\\nforts, the Budget provides $7.5 billion in mandatory funding for comprehensive modernization \\nof targeted Public Housing communities.92 DePARTMeNT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DeVeLOPMeNT\\n• Invests in Affordable Housing in Tribal Communities .  Native Americans are seven \\ntimes more likely to live in overcrowded conditions and five times more likely to have inad -\\nequate plumbing, kitchen, or heating systems than all U.S. households.  The Budget provides \\n$1.1 billion, a $33 million increase above the 2023 level, to support tribal efforts to expand \\naffordable housing, improve housing conditions and infrastructure, and increase economic op -\\nportunities for low-income families.  Of this total, $150 million would prioritize activities that \\nadvance resilience and energy efficiency in housing-related projects. 93DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR\\nThe President’s 2025 Budget:  \\n• Honors Commitments to Tribal Communities.   Incorporating feedback from tribal con -\\nsultations, the Budget continues to provide robust support for indigenous communities and \\nupholds Federal trust responsibilities while working to advance equity.

The President’s 2025 Budget for DOI:  protects \\nenvironmental resources by investing in ecosystem restoration, wildfire management, and public \\nland resilience to ensure healthy lands and waters; enhances programs that advance racial and \\neconomic justice and honors commitments to tribal nations; and supports development in U.S. \\nTerritories and freely associated states.\\nThe Budget requests $17.8 billion in discretionary budget authority for 2025, a $0.8 billion or \\n4.8-percent increase from the 2023 level.  The 2025 Budget advances DOI’s mission through \\ninvestments in wildfire management, tribal programs, ecosystem restoration, national park \\noperations, western water infrastructure, and climate resilience.  The Budget demonstrates the \\ncontinued support of the Compacts of Free Association with Palau, the Federated States of \\nMicronesia, and the Marshall Islands, which are critical to U.S. national security.94 DePARTMeNT OF THe INTeRIOR\\nprograms addressing needs highlighted by the Federal Boarding School Initiative and its re -\\ncently concluded Road to Healing Tour.  To strengthen tribal land management and promote \\ntribal sovereignty through tribal co-stewardship, the Budget includes a new $8 million alloca -\\ntion of mandatory funding from the Land and Water Conservation Fund to support tribal land \\nacquisition for conservation and outdoor recreation.  \\n• Strengthens Climate Resilience in Communities and Ecosystems.  Across America, \\ncommunities are enduring historic and catastrophic flooding, wildfires, extreme heat, drought, \\nand more, while longer-term changes in temperature will continue to affect ecosystems and \\nthe economies that depend on them.  The intensifying impacts of climate change are costing \\nlives, disrupting livelihoods, and causing billions of dollars in damages.  The Budget provides \\n$5.5 billion in climate adaptation and resilience to address the increasing severity of extreme \\nweather events fueled by climate change.  As a key steward of America’s public lands and \\nwaters, and with a primary responsibility to uphold the Nation’s commitments to American \\nIndians and Alaska Natives, DOI plays a critical role in combating the climate crisis.  The \\nBudget provides DOI the resources to invest in community partnerships and science-based \\nland management.  The Budget complements the historic Bipartisan Infrastructure Law \\nand the Inflation Reduction Act, which dedicate more than $50 billion across the Federal \\nGovernment to advance climate resilience strategies in every community in America, includ -\\ning in support of the Justice40 Initiative to ensure that these investments reach communities \\nthat need them the most.  \\n• Advances Climate Science. \\xa0 The Budget includes $275\\xa0million at DOI to continue to lever -\\nage science to better understand the impacts of climate change and to inform and improve \\nland management practices from the Federal to the local level.

These investments would build upon the nearly $100 million increase in base \\nappropriations for these agencies since the beginning of the Administration, in addition \\nto the $200 million in American Rescue Plan Act funding the Administration secured for \\nthe agencies to address the unprecedented COVID-19 emergency.  The Budget would en -\\nable DOL to protect workers’ wages and benefits, ensure that children are working only \\nin conditions that are safe and legal, address the misclassification of workers as indepen -\\ndent contractors, and improve workplace health and safety.  Since 2019, DOL has seen an  \\n88-percent increase in children being employed illegally by companies.  The Administration \\nis focused on preventing and addressing child labor exploitation, and has assessed more \\nthan $16 million in child labor penalties since taking office.  The Budget includes funding \\nto combat exploitative child labor, including among migrant children, who are particularly \\nvulnerable.  The Budget also includes funding to implement the significant reforms to em -\\nployer-sponsored retirement plans enacted in the SeCURe 2.0 Act of 2022, helping to ensure \\nthat workers’ retirement plans are always protected.\\n• Expands Access to Paid Family and Medical Leave and Proposes Paid Sick Days.  \\nThe vast majority of America’s workers do not have access to employer-provided paid family \\nleave, including 73 percent of private sector workers.  Among the lowest-paid workers, who \\nare disproportionately women and workers of color, 94 percent lack access to paid family \\nleave through their employers.  In addition, as many as one in five retirees leave the work -\\nforce earlier than planned to care for an ill family member, which negatively impacts families \\nas well as the Nation’s labor supply and productivity.  The Budget proposes to establish a \\nnational, comprehensive paid family and medical leave program administered by the Social The Department of Labor (DOL) is responsible for protecting the health, safety , wages, and \\neconomic security of workers and retirees.  The President’s 2025 Budget for DOL supports:  \\nbuilding the skills of America’s workers; protecting workers’ rights and benefits, health and safety, \\nand wages; strengthening the integrity and accessibility of the Unemployment Insurance (UI) \\nprogram; and creating good jobs that are safe and equitable, provide fair wages and benefits, \\nempower workers, and offer opportunities for advancement and a pathway to the middle class.  \\nThe Budget requests $13.9 billion in discretionary budget authority for 2025, a $318 million or \\n2.3-percent increase from the 2023 level.  102 DePARTMeNT OF LABOR\\nSecurity Administration to ensure that all workers can take up to 12 weeks of leave to bond \\nwith a new child; care for a seriously ill loved one; heal from their own serious illness; address \\ncircumstances arising from a loved one’s military deployment; find safety from domestic vio -\\nlence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking—otherwise known as “safe leave”; or up to \\nthree days to grieve the death of a loved one.  The Budget also invests in a program at DOL’s \\nWomen’s Bureau to help States expand access to paid leave benefits, including through grants \\nto support States in implementing new paid leave programs and through the creation of a \\nTechnical Assistance Hub to share best practices among States.  Further, the President contin -\\nues to call on the Congress to require employers to provide seven job-protected paid sick days \\neach year to all workers, and ensure that employers cannot penalize workers for taking time \\noff to address their health needs, or the health needs of their families, or for safe leave.\\n• Expands Workforce Training and Provides Pathways to In-Demand Jobs for More \\nAmericans.  The President’s historic legislative accomplishments are rebuilding U.S. infra -\\nstructure, supporting clean energy, boosting American manufacturing, and creating millions \\nof high-quality jobs.  The Administration has worked with States, localities, and community-\\nbased organizations to leverage American Rescue Plan Act, Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, \\nInflation Reduction Act, and CHIPS and Science Act resources to advance effective, evidence-\\nbased training models that ensure all workers, particularly women, workers of color, those \\nliving in rural areas, workers with disabilities, and others underrepresented in growing fields, \\nhave the skills they need to compete for and fill these and other jobs.  The Budget makes ma -\\njor new investments in expanding these strategies, through an $8 billion mandatory Career \\nTraining Fund and a $50 million new Sectoral employment through Career Training for \\nOccupational Readiness program, both of which would support the development and expan -\\nsion of public-private partnerships among employers, education and training providers, and \\ncommunity-based groups to equitably deliver evidence-based, high-quality training, focused \\non creating pathways into good jobs in growing, in-demand industries.  The Career Training \\nFund would provide full funding for 750,000 individuals to enroll in evidence-based training \\nprograms, such as Registered Apprenticeships, that are proven to deliver sustained earnings \\nincreases.  These new investments would supplement Workforce Innovation and Opportunity \\nAct programs by providing the resources necessary to deliver high-quality training at scale.   \\n• Broadens Access to Registered Apprenticeships .  The Budget increases support for \\nRegistered Apprenticeships, an evidence-based earn-and-learn model that is a critical tool for \\ntraining future workforces for good jobs in the clean energy, construction, semiconductor, trans -\\nportation and logistics, education, health, and other growing and in-demand industries.  The \\nBudget invests $335 million, a $50 million increase above the 2023\\xa0enacted level, and supports \\nexpanding existing Registered Apprenticeship programs in clean energy-related occupations.  \\nThis investment would also be used to increase the number of workers from historically un -\\nderrepresented groups, including people of color, women, and people with disabilities, who \\nparticipate in Registered Apprenticeships.\\n• Centers Community Colleges in American Workforce Development .  The President \\nrecognizes the crucial role that community colleges play in making high-quality training ac -\\ncessible to all Americans.  For this reason, the Budget invests $70 million, a $5 million increase \\nabove the 2023 enacted level, in the Strengthening Community College training program, \\nwhich builds community colleges’ capacity to work with the public workforce development \\nsystem and employers to design and deliver high-quality, evidence-based training programs in \\ncommunities across the Nation.BUDGeT OF THe U. S. GOVeRNMeNT FOR FISCAL YeAR 2025 103\\n• Expands Penalties when Employers Violate Workers’ Rights to Organize, Receive \\nFair Wages, or Have a Safe and Healthy Workplace Free from Discrimination.  For \\ntoo long, employers have only received a slap on the wrist—at most—when they fire or retali -\\nate against workers for exercising their right to organize and collectively bargain, steal wages \\nfrom workers, force workers to work in unsafe conditions, exploit children, or otherwise fla -\\ngrantly violate the Nation’s labor laws.  To create meaningful deterrence for employers from \\nviolating workers’ rights, ensure those who do violate their rights are held accountable, and \\nlevel the playing field for responsible employers, the Budget proposes instituting and signifi -\\ncantly increasing penalties at DOL, the equal employment Opportunity Commission, and the \\nNational Labor Relations Board for employers that violate workplace safety and, health, wage \\nand hour, child labor, equal opportunity, and labor organizing rules.\\n• Modernizes, Protects, and Strengthens UI.  The UI program provides a critical safety net \\nfor workers who have lost a job through no fault of their own and helps protect the economy as \\na whole from further damage during downturns.  The Budget invests $3.5 billion, an increase \\nof $313 million above the 2023\\xa0enacted level, to modernize, protect, and strengthen the UI pro -\\ngram.  This includes investments to tackle fraud and support more robust identity verification \\nfor UI applicants.  Further, the Budget proposes a comprehensive legislative package designed \\nto provide States with new tools and resources to combat UI fraud and improper payments \\nwhile ensuring equity and accessibility for all claimants.  The Budget also includes principles \\nto guide future efforts to reform the UI system, including improving benefit levels and access, \\nscaling UI benefits automatically during recessions, expanding eligibility to reflect the modern \\nlabor force, improving Federal and State solvency through more equitable and progressive fi -\\nnancing, expanding reemployment services, and further safeguarding the program from fraud.\\n• Strengthens Mental Health Parity Protections.  The Budget requires all health plans to \\ncover mental health and substance use disorder benefits, ensures that plans have an adequate \\nnetwork of behavioral health providers, and improves DOL’s ability to enforce the law.  In ad -\\ndition, the Budget includes $275 million over 10 years to increase the Department’s capacity \\nto ensure that large group market health plans and issuers comply with mental health and \\nsubstance use disorder requirements, and to take action against plans and issuers that do not \\ncomply.\\n• Proposes to Reauthorize the Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) Program.  The TAA \\nprogram provides employment services, job training, income support, job search allowances, \\nand relocation allowances for workers who lose their jobs due to trade.  Since the program’s \\nexpiration in 2022, however, approximately 10,000 trade-affected workers per month have \\nbeen deprived of these services.  The Administration proposes to reauthorize the TAA program \\nthat expired in 2022, and looks forward to working with the Congress on a broader reauthori -\\nzation to modernize the program to help trade-affected workers return to quality employment \\nas quickly as possible.\\n• Helps to Ensure Compliance with the Labor Provisions of the United States-Mexico \\n-Canada Agreement (USMCA). \\xa0 The Budget includes a $45 million increase for the Bureau \\nof International Labor Affairs to allow it to continue Mexico-specific technical assistance in \\nsupport of ongoing USMCA implementation by advancing labor protections, improving work -\\ning conditions, stabilizing labor relations, and increasing public awareness and engagement.\\n• Builds Capacity and Infrastructure for Responsible Artificial Intelligence (AI) Use \\nand Innovation. \\xa0  The Budget includes funding for a new AI policy office to oversee and \\nmanage AI-related work at the Department.\\xa0 The office, led by\\xa0a new Chief AI Officer, would 104 DePARTMeNT OF LABOR\\nguide the effective use of AI, promote AI innovation in DOL programs, and help DOL agen -\\ncies mitigate risk, as well as coordinate the AI-related activities already occurring across the \\nDepartment.105DEPARTMENT OF STATE AND OTHER \\nINTERNATIONAL PROGRAMS\\nThe President’s 2025 Budget:  \\n• Drives Inclusive and Sustainable Economic Growth and Quality International \\nInfrastructure through the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment \\n(PGI).   The Budget advances the President’s goal of mobilizing $200 billion for infrastruc -\\nture investment in low- and middle-income countries by 2027, building on the $30 billion in \\nfinancing already mobilized by the Administration, which was announced by the President \\nat the May 2023 G7 Summit.  PGI aims to promote infrastructure development along critical \\neconomic corridors to drive inclusive and sustainable economic growth, secure energy sup -\\nply chains, fortify trusted digital connectivity, advance gender equality and equity, and build \\nmore resilient food and health systems, as well as critical transport and logistics networks.  \\nThe Budget includes approximately $50 billion for PGI across all departments and agencies, \\ninclusive of private sector financing leveraged, including $250 million in flexible resources \\nto support strategic, high-quality infrastructure to connect workers to good jobs, allow busi -\\nnesses to grow and thrive, and advance shared national security priorities.  To further PGI \\ngoals, the Budget includes $2 billion in mandatory funding over five years to establish the \\nInternational Infrastructure Fund to combat People’s Republic of China (PRC) coercive fi -\\nnancing, and spur U.S. economic growth.  This includes development of the Port of Rades in \\nTunisia and includes $200 million for the Millennium Challenge Corporation with a focus The Department of State (State), U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), and \\nother international programs deliver on the President’s vision of a more free, open, secure, and \\nprosperous world in which all Americans and people everywhere have the opportunity to reach \\ntheir full potential.  The President’s 2025 Budget strengthens U.S. national security to Out-\\nCompete China and counter Russian aggression, revitalize long-standing U.S. alliances and \\npartnerships, and galvanize a U.S. global response to shared challenges in nearly 200 countries.\\nThe Budget requests $64.4 billion in discretionary budget authority for 2025 for State, USAID, and \\nother international programs, a $0.7 billion or 1.1-percent increase from the estimated 2023 level \\nwhich includes actual offsetting collections and fee revenue.

The Budget also includes $2.5 billion for international programs at the Department of the \\nTreasury, a $0.1 billion or 5-percent increase from the estimated 2023 level.\\nIn addition, the Budget includes a request for unmet needs from the Administration’s October \\n2023 supplemental request for urgent security needs through the end of 2024.106 DePARTMeNT OF STATe AND O THeR INTeRNATIONAL PROGRAMS\\non critical investments across Africa.  The Budget also leverages U.S. Development Finance \\nCorporation investments to strengthen U.S. global infrastructure.   \\n• Provides Lifesaving Humanitarian Assistance and Combats Global Food Insecurity.   \\nThe Budget provides $10.3 billion in lifesaving humanitarian and refugee assistance to sup -\\nport more than 330 million people in need in more than 70 countries, in addition to the October \\n2023 emergency supplemental request of $10 billion to address the unprecedented humanitar -\\nian need globally.  The Budget also fully supports the President’s commitment to resettle up \\nto 125,000 refugees in the United States, as well as the enduring Welcome and Safe Mobility \\nOffice initiatives.  The Budget also provides more than $1 billion to support the President’s \\npledge to alleviate global food insecurity, including $100 million for the Vision for Adapted \\nCrops and Soils, as part of the overall U.S. Government’s flagship food security initiative, \\nFeed the Future, which works to build more resilient and sustainable food systems and nutri -\\ntious food crops in underserved regions.  State and USAID would have to reduce lifesaving \\nassistance around the globe without the additional $10 billion in humanitarian assistance \\nrequested in the Administration’s October 2023 national security supplemental request.\\n• Unlocks New Lending to Address Global Challenges and Provides a Credible \\nAlternative to the PRC’s Coercive Lending.   The Budget builds on the Administration’s \\nOctober 2023 supplemental request and unlocks roughly $36 billion in new World Bank financ -\\ning to address global challenges by leveraging $1 billion in contributions to the World Bank, \\nlargely for International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) loan guarantees.  \\nThis funding would provide an alternative to the PRC’s coercive financing and address global \\nchallenges.\\n• Disrupts the International Synthetic Drug Trade.   The Budget includes $169 million \\nacross State and USAID to counter fentanyl and other synthetic drug production and traffick -\\ning, which is 58 percent above 2023 levels.  These resources would counter the worldwide flow \\nof fentanyl and other synthetics that endanger public safety and health, and contribute to tens \\nof thousands of drug-overdose deaths in the United States annually.\\n• Galvanizes Action against Strategic Competitors.   The Budget builds on the \\nAdministration’s October 2023 supplemental request and provides approximately $1.5 billion \\nto counter Russian aggression across europe, eurasia, and Central Asia, including more than \\n$300 million to support procurement of American equipment across the region and $482 million \\nfor Ukraine to continue its efforts to expel Russian forces from its territory, establish civilian \\nsecurity in newly liberated territories, and spur economic growth.

The Indo-\\nPacific Strategy total also includes $2 billion to support diplomatic presence and programs in \\nthe region, including new and planned U.S. diplomatic posts in the Pacific and Indian Oceans.  \\nThe Budget reflects a substantial commitment to the Indo-Pacific and relies on the $2 billion \\ninvestment that the Administration requested in the October 2023 national security supple -\\nmental request in security assistance to fully address urgent regional security needs and deter \\nacts of aggression.\\n• Achieves the Administration’s Historic Climate Finance Pledge.   The Budget pro -\\nvides a path to achieving the President’s $11 billion commitment for international climate \\nfinance, including $3 billion for the President’s Emergency Plan for Adaptation and Resilience \\n(PREPARE) .  A signature initiative, PRePARe supports more than half a billion people in \\ndeveloping countries to adapt to and manage the impacts of climate change.  The Budget \\nalso supports a $500 million contribution through mandatory funding to finance the Green \\nClimate Fund, as part of the $3 billion multiyear pledge to expand climate adaptation and \\nmitigation projects in developing countries, and $100 million for the Amazon Fund to combat \\ndeforestation and preserve the world’s largest tropical rainforest.  The Budget builds on his -\\ntoric international climate finance progress made over the course of the Administration, in \\nwhich estimated 2023 levels of $9.5 billion represent a near-six-fold increase from 2021.\\n• Protects Americans at Home and Abroad, and Strengthens Health Systems Globally.  \\nThe Budget provides nearly $10 billion for global health programs, which would increase sup -\\nport for global health programs, strengthening health systems, and pandemic preparedness.  \\nThe Budget fulfills the President’s commitment to the seventh replenishment of the Global \\nFund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria by providing $1.2 billion to match $1 for every \\n$2 contributed by other donors.  The Budget also provides more than $900 million for global \\nhealth security, including $250 million for the Pandemic Fund.  The Budget invests $30 million \\nin new resources for the World Bank’s Global Financing Facility for Women, Children, and \\nAdolescents, a contribution anticipated to leverage at least $210 million to strengthen health \\nsystems, and $20 million for the Administration’s Global Health Worker Initiative to better \\ntrain, equip, and protect the health workforce.  In addition, the Budget includes loan guaran -\\ntees to the World Bank’s IBRD to support investments in global challenges, including pandemic \\npreparedness, which would bolster the impact of these global health activities.\\n• Fulfills the President’s Commitment to Central America and Strengthens America’s \\nPartnership in the Western Hemisphere.   The Budget provides approximately $1 billion \\nfor Central American programming to meet the President’s commitment to invest $4 billion in \\nCentral America over four years to address the root causes of migration.

Absent congressional action on this emergency request, \\nthe United States would not be able to provide the necessary support to Ukraine, and State \\nand USAID would have to reduce lifesaving assistance around the globe.  The Administration \\nappreciates the bipartisan supplemental legislation that passed the Senate and would address \\nthese urgent needs.111DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATIONUNITEDSTATESOFAMERICA\\nDEPARTMENTOFTRANSPORTATION\\nThe President’s 2025 Budget:  \\n• Continues Implementation of the President’s Historic Bipartisan Infrastructure \\nLaw.  The Budget provides a total of $78.4 billion for highway, highway safety, and tran -\\nsit formula programs, supporting the amounts authorized for year four of the Bipartisan \\nInfrastructure Law.  This includes $62.1 billion in obligation limitation funding for the \\nFederal-aid Highways program, an increase of $3.3 billion above the 2023 enacted level and \\n$15.7\\xa0billion above the enacted level for 2021, the year prior to enactment of the Bipartisan \\nInfrastructure Law.  This funding would support construction and safety projects of highways \\nand bridges across the United States.  The Budget also includes $14.3 billion for Transit \\nFormula Grants, a $645 million increase above the 2023 enacted level, to support core capital \\nand planning programs for transit agencies across the Nation, as well as transit research, \\ntechnical assistance, and data collection.  The Budget also reflects an additional $9.5 billion \\nin advance appropriations provided by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law for bridge replace -\\nment and rehabilitation, electric vehicle charging infrastructure, and other programs to \\nimprove the safety, sustainability, and resilience of America’s transportation network. \\n• Prioritizes Investment in the FAA.  The Budget provides $17.5 billion in discretionary \\nbudget authority for the FAA, an increase of $2.1 billion above the 2023 enacted level, less \\nCongressional Directed Spending.  This funding supports robust hiring and training of air \\ntraffic controllers started in 2023 to rebuild the pipeline of new controllers needed to safely \\nmeet projected air traffic demands.  The Budget also continues FAA’s multiyear effort of The Department of Transportation (DOT) is responsible for delivering the world’s leading \\ntransportation system, serving the American people and economy through the safe, efficient, \\nsustainable, and equitable movement of goods and people.  The President’s 2025 Budget \\nfor DOT continues to complement the President’s historic Bipartisan Infrastructure Law by:  \\ncontinuing to rebuild and modernizing America’s roads, bridges, rail, transit systems, and airports; \\nand prioritizing significant investments in the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to ensure \\nthe agency has the people, facilities, and equipment necessary for a safe and efficient National \\nAirspace System (NAS).  \\nThe Budget requests $25.4 billion in discretionary budget authority for 2025.  The Budget also \\nincludes $81.7 billion in obligation limitations and $1.9 billion in mandatory resources, as well as \\n$36.8 billion in emergency-designated advance budget authority, for transportation infrastructure \\nand safety investments in 2025.  In total, the Budget represents an increase of $58 billion or \\na 67-percent increase above the enacted level for 2021, the year prior to enactment of the \\nBipartisan Infrastructure Law, demonstrating the Administration’s commitment to rebuilding and \\nmodernizing America’s infrastructure.112 DePARTMeNT OF TRANSPORTATION\\nreforming aircraft certification as well as increasing its safety oversight capabilities.  In addi -\\ntion, the Budget increases investment in the facilities and systems that comprise the NAS by \\nover $650 million for a total investment of $3.6\\xa0billion, to ensure the NAS continues to safely \\naccommodate the growth in traditional commercial aviation traffic alongside new entrants \\nfrom the commercial space, unmanned aircraft, and advanced air mobility industries.  The \\nAdministration also proposes to increase the fuel tax for high-end business jets, to better align \\nthe costs of the services provided to those users on the system.\\n• Modernizes FAA Facilities .  The Administration supports a long-term FAA authorization \\nthat:  improves safety; enables access to the system by current and emerging users; reduces \\nemissions and improves resiliency; and expands consumer protections and access.  However, \\nit would be difficult to achieve these important goals if FAA does not have the modern facili -\\nties and systems necessary to operate the NAS.  Over the last decade, FAA capital spending \\nhas not kept up with the Agency’s needs.  Therefore, the Budget proposes a five-year, $8 billion \\nmandatory program to significantly modernize FAA’s major facilities and radars.  This effort \\nwould ensure that the American people and all travelers can continue to depend on a safe, \\nmodern, and efficient aviation system.\\n• Builds on Investments for a Safe and Efficient Passenger and Freight Rail Network.  \\nThe Budget expands on the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law’s already significant investments to -\\nward improving the safety and efficiency of the Nation’s rail network.  This includes $2.5 billion \\nfor grants to Amtrak, along with $250 million for the Consolidated Rail Infrastructure and \\nSafety Improvements program, a flexible and oversubscribed competitive grant program that \\nadvances the Justice40 Initiative.  These amounts are in addition to the $13.2 billion in rail \\nfunding directly provided by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.  In addition, the Budget in -\\ncreases funding for critical safety programs, such as $8 million for the Confidential Close Call \\nReporting System, doubling the 2023\\xa0enacted level.  This program, which all Class I railroads \\nhave agreed to join, allows railroads and their employees to report unsafe events and condi -\\ntions without fear of reprisal. \\n• Supports the Nation’s Transit Systems .  The Nation’s transit systems play a critical role \\nin:  ensuring riders can access jobs, school, healthcare, and opportunity;  spurring sustainable \\neconomic development; reducing highway congestion; and lowering greenhouse gas emissions.  \\nThe Budget includes $2.4 billion for the Capital Investment Grant program, which provides \\nessential funding for transit expansion projects.  At the same time, the Budget recognizes that \\nmany transit systems face an uncertain future as ridership and fare revenue have still not ful -\\nly rebounded to pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels.  To ensure transit continues to be a vital and \\nviable transportation option, the Budget includes language to temporarily allow larger transit \\nsystems to use existing formula funds for operating expenses, and also encourages States to \\nsupport their transit systems.\\n• Makes Supply Chains More Resilient and Moves Goods More Quickly through the \\nNation’s Ports and Waterways.   The Budget continues support for modernizing America’s \\nport and waterway infrastructure initiated under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.  The \\nBudget includes $80 million for the Port Infrastructure Development Program to strengthen \\nmaritime freight capacity on top of the $450 million in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law for \\n2025.  In addition to keeping the Nation’s supply chain moving by improving efficiency, DOT \\nwould prioritize projects that also lower emissions—reducing environmental impact in and \\naround the Nation’s ports.

The Budget provides \\n$800\\xa0 million for the Rebuilding American Infrastructure with Sustainability and equity \\n(RAISe) and National Infrastructure Project Assistance—also known as the Mega grant pro -\\ngram—competitive grant programs, matching the 2023 enacted level for National Infrastructure \\nInvestments, by redirecting balances from the Transportation Infrastructure Finance and \\nInnovation Act program.  The RAISe and Mega grant programs support innovative highway, \\ntransit, passenger rail, freight, port and other transportation projects across the Nation, and \\nadvance the Justice40 Initiative.  The RAISe program invests in locally- or regionally-signifi -\\ncant projects such as complete streets projects that improve transportation options and protect \\nall transportation system users, infrastructure to support healthier and more sustainable \\nmeans of travel, and projects that provide significant benefits to disadvantaged communities.  \\nThe Mega program accelerates delivery of larger projects that can transform and better con -\\nnect regions and strengthen major supply chain networks, such as the Brent Spence Bridge \\nProject connecting Kentucky and Ohio, and the I-5 Bridge Replacement Project connecting \\nOregon and Washington. \\n• Addresses the Roadway and Pedestrian Safety Crisis .  Despite improvements in vehicle \\nsafety technologies, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) estimates \\nthat 42,795 people died in motor vehicle traffic crashes in 2022.  While this is a very small de -\\ncrease from 2021, the Nation continues to face a national crisis of traffic deaths on America’s \\nroadways.  The Budget provides $1.3 billion for NHTSA, which is $83\\xa0million above the 2023 \\nenacted level, to conduct critical research to reduce roadway fatalities and injuries on the \\nNation’s highways.  The Budget also includes increased funding for the newly formed Office of \\nAutomation Safety which would lead NHTSA’s efforts to safely and securely integrate autono -\\nmous vehicles onto the Nation’s roadways.  The Office of Automation Safety, in coordination \\nwith NHTSA research, would address vehicle cyber security risks as well as risks related to \\nartificial intelligence, in alignment with the implementation of executive Order 14110, “Safe, \\nSecure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence.”  The Budget also \\nprovides almost $965\\xa0million to the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration to continue \\nits essential safety activities, including its Large Truck and Medium-Duty Truck Crash Causal \\nFactors Studies. \\n• Invests in Merchant Mariner Training .

The Budget \\nalso proposes $86 million in priority maintenance and improvement projects at the USMMA \\ncampus.115DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY\\nThe President’s 2025 Budget:  \\n• Protects Improvements to Taxpayer Experience and Supports Ensuring the \\nWealthy and Big Corporations Pay the Taxes They Owe.  The Inflation Reduction Act \\naddressed long-standing Internal Revenue Service (IRS) funding deficiencies by providing \\nstable, multi-year funding to improve tax compliance by finally cracking down on high-income \\nindividuals and corporations who have too often avoided paying their lawfully owed taxes, \\nand improving service for the millions of Americans who do pay their taxes.  The IRS is us -\\ning Inflation Reduction Act funding to modernize its information technology infrastructure, \\nadminister new clean energy tax credits, rebuild the administrative capacity of the Agency \\nto better assist taxpayers, and crack down on tax evasion by the wealthy and big corpora -\\ntions.  These goals can only be realized if annual discretionary appropriations are provided \\nto maintain and protect current services.  To ensure that taxpayers continue to receive high-\\nquality customer service and that all Americans are treated fairly by the U.S. tax system, the \\nBudget maintains annual funding at the 2023 level for all IRS activities and provides a total \\nof $12.3 billion for the Agency.  In addition to annual discretionary funding, the Budget pro -\\nposes to restore the full Inflation Reduction Act investment and provide new funding over the \\nlong-term to maintain progress on service enhancements and deficit-reducing tax compliance \\ninitiatives.  This proposal reflects a robust research base demonstrating that program integ -\\nrity investments to enforce existing tax laws increase revenues in a progressive way and, in \\ndoing so, shrink the tax gap—the difference between taxes owed and taxes paid.\\n• Promotes Access to Capital to Underserved Communities.  The Budget provides \\n$325\\xa0million for the Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFI) Fund, an in -\\ncrease of $1 million above the 2023 level, and $55 million, or a 20-percent increase above the \\n2021 level, to provide access to credit and technical assistance to historically underserved The Department of the Treasury (Treasury) is responsible for maintaining a strong economy, \\npromoting economic conditions that enable inclusive growth and stability, protecting the integrity \\nof the financial system, combating global financial crime and corruption, and managing the U.S. \\nGovernment’s finances and resources effectively.  The President’s 2025 Budget for Treasury:  \\nsupports a fair and robust tax system that ensures the wealthy and large corporations pay \\nthe taxes they owe; maintains improved taxpayer experience and service; combats terrorism \\nand financial crime; promotes community development and access to credit in disadvantaged \\ncommunities; strengthens corporate transparency; and builds institutional capacity to address \\nemerging issues and advance equity across all Treasury programs.\\nThe Budget requests $14.4 billion in discretionary budget authority for 2025, a $0.2 billion or a \\n1.2-percent increase from the 2023 level.116 DePARTMeNT OF THe TReASURY\\nand often low-income communities.  To address the shortage of long-term affordable credit for \\ndevelopment projects in disadvantaged communities, the Budget also includes a $10 million \\nsubsidy for the CDFI Fund’s Bond Guarantee Program and proposes changes to broaden par -\\nticipation while still minimizing the risk of loss to the Federal Government.  The Budget would \\nalso broaden access to the Small Dollar Loan Program, allowing more organizations to par -\\nticipate in the program that supports individuals seeking affordable credit building loans and \\nalternatives to costly payday loans.\\n• Combats Terrorism and Corruption and Increases Corporate Transparency.  Treasury \\nplays a leading role in monitoring and disrupting corruption, money laundering, terrorist fi -\\nnancing, the use of the financial system by malicious actors domestically and abroad, and \\ncombatting the trafficking of illicit substances such as fentanyl in American communities.  The \\nBudget provides $231 million to the Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, $15 million \\nabove the 2023 level, to expand Treasury’s capacity to provide financial intelligence and con -\\nduct sanctions-related economic analysis while continuing to modernize the sanctions process.  \\nThese investments would expand Treasury’s ability to craft, implement, and enforce sanctions, \\nincluding the historic sanctions program targeting Russia’s illegal war in Ukraine, and sanc -\\ntions on key Hamas terrorist group members and financial facilitators in Gaza. The Budget \\nalso provides $216 million for the Financial Crimes enforcement Network, $26 million above \\nthe 2023 level, to support Beneficial Ownership Information reporting which will be required \\nfor existing covered companies beginning in 2025.  This reporting will provide investigative \\ntools making it harder for bad actors to hide or benefit from their ill-gotten gains through shell \\ncompanies or other opaque ownership structures. \\n• Builds Critical Agency Capacity to Address Emerging Threats.   The Budget pro -\\nvides $312\\xa0 million for Treasury’s Departmental Offices, an increase of $38 million, or a  \\n14-percent increase above the 2023 level, to continue to rebuild staffing levels for Treasury’s \\ncore policy offices and support Treasury’s role in promoting investment security in sensitive \\ntechnologies and products critical to the national security of the United States.  The increase \\nin funding would also allow Treasury to support a Chief Artificial Intelligence Officer to ensure \\nresponsible use and development of artificial intelligence capabilities.  The Budget builds in -\\nstitutional capacity to support Treasury-wide coordination of program evaluation and expand \\nengagement with historically underrepresented and underserved groups to advance equity \\nacross all Treasury programs.\\n• Strengthens Enterprise Cybersecurity.   The Budget provides $150 million for the \\nCybersecurity enhancement Account, an increase of $50 million above the 2023 level, to \\nprotect and defend sensitive agency systems and information, including those designated as \\nhigh-value assets.  The Budget increases centralized funding to strengthen Treasury’s overall \\ncybersecurity efforts and to continue the implementation of a Zero Trust Architecture.  These \\ninvestments would protect Treasury’s systems, and the American public’s sensitive data safe -\\nguarded within these systems, from future attacks.  The Budget also provides $396 million for \\nthe Bureau of the Fiscal Service, $24 million above the 2023\\xa0level.  This includes funding to \\nenhance the security posture of core Government financial systems by modernizing and tran -\\nsitioning all mainframe applications to the secure cloud. 117DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS\\nThe President’s 2025 Budget:  \\n• Expands Healthcare, Benefits, and Services for Environmental Exposures.

The Budget includes $1.4 billion for \\nR&D on climate and clean energy technologies, an increase of $80 million from the 2023 \\nenacted level.  This investment supports a broad portfolio of research that includes:  at -\\nmospheric composition; water and carbon cycles; renewable energy technologies; climate \\nresilience technologies for communities heavily affected by climate change; and social, be -\\nhavioral, and economic research on human responses to climate change, among other topics.The National Science Foundation (NSF) is responsible for promoting the progress of science \\nand innovation, including advancing science education.  The President’s 2025 Budget for NSF \\nbuilds on previous years’ investments and furthers the goals of the CHIPS and Science Act, \\nincluding:  strengthening U.S. leadership in artificial intelligence (AI) and other critical emerging \\ntechnologies; boosting research and development, including for combating the climate crisis; \\nsupporting the Nation’s research infrastructure; advancing equity while promoting education \\nand workforce development in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM); and \\nincreasing research security and oversight.\\nThe Budget requests $10.2 billion in discretionary budget authority for 2025, a $644 million or \\n6.8-percent increase from the 2023 level.130 NATIONAL SCIeNCe FOUNDATION\\n• Bolsters the Nation’s Research Infrastructure.  The Budget  includes $300 million for \\nresearch infrastructure at NSF to support the construction and procurement of research fa -\\ncilities and instrumentation across the Nation to enable scientific and technological advances.  \\nThe Budget provides support for:  upgrades to the Large Hadron Collider, the world’s largest \\nparticle accelerator; construction of the Leadership-Class Computing Facility to support sci -\\nence and engineering research that requires the largest and most computationally intensive \\ncapabilities; and long-term upgrades of NSF’s major Antarctic infrastructure.  The Budget \\nalso includes support for continued design and development work for a single extremely large \\ntelescope, which has the potential to advance ground-based astronomy observing capabilities \\nfor U.S. researchers.\\n• Promotes Equity in STEM Education and Workforce Training.   In support of the \\nCHIPS and Science Act’s priority of building a diverse, STeM-capable workforce, the Budget \\nprovides $1.4 billion for STeM education and workforce development programs at NSF that \\nhave an emphasis on diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility.  Within this amount, the \\nBudget includes $592 million, an increase of $51 million from the 2023 enacted level, for \\nprograms focused on increasing the participation of groups historically underrepresented in \\nscience and engineering fields, including women and girls and people of color, by supporting:  \\ncurriculum design; research on successful recruitment and retention methods; development of \\noutreach or mentorship programs; fellowships; and building science and engineering research \\nand education capacity at Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Tribally Controlled \\nColleges and Universities, and Minority-Serving Institutions. \\n• Increases Research Security and Oversight.   The Budget includes $18 million for re -\\nsearch security activities at NSF, an increase of $6 million from the 2023 enacted level, to \\nidentify risks to the U.S. research enterprise and to develop policies and best practices to \\nmitigate against those risks.  The Budget also includes support for the expanded role of the \\nOffice of the Inspector General to conduct oversight and prosecution cases of sexual assault \\nand harassment in the United States Antarctic Program.131SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION\\nThe President’s 2025 Budget:  \\n• Expands Access to Capital for Small Businesses.   Building on the historic growth in \\nsmall business applications under the President and Vice President’s leadership, the Budget \\nsupports historic lending levels across SBA’s business lending programs, including:  the 7(a) \\nbusiness loan guarantee; capital for major fixed assets, otherwise known as a 504 loan guar -\\nantee; the Small Business Investment Company (SBIC) program; and Microloan programs.  \\nThe over $58\\xa0billion in lending provided in the Budget would address the need for greater \\naccess to affordable capital, particularly in underserved communities.  The Budget proposes \\na new direct 7(a) lending program, which would further enable SBA to address gaps in access \\nto small dollar lending.    In addition, increasing the authorized lending level for the SBIC \\nprogram by 16 percent to $7\\xa0billion would significantly expand the availability of venture \\ncapital funding for small businesses.\\n• Supports Disaster Mitigation and Recovery.   As communities across the Nation face \\nincreased risks from natural disasters, the Budget continues to support SBA’s Disaster Loan \\nProgram, a program that is vital to ensuring SBA can continue to administer low-interest \\ndisaster loans that provide a financial lifeline for homeowners and businesses recovering \\nfrom natural disasters.\\n• Delivers Equitable Access to Counseling and Training Resources.   The Budget pro -\\nvides $20\\xa0million for the Community Navigator Pilot Program, which works with community \\norganizations to provide and amplify awareness of free and low-cost business counseling \\nand training resources.  Community Navigators are reducing resource and access barriers in \\nunderserved communities, including veterans, women, rural communities, and communities \\nof color. The Small Business Administration (SBA) is responsible for ensuring that small businesses, \\nentrepreneurs, innovative startups, and disaster-impacted communities have access to the tools \\nand resources they need to start, recover, build, and grow.  The President’s 2025 Budget for \\nSBA supports comprehensive and equitable access to business technical assistance services, \\naffordable capital, and Government contracting opportunities.\\nThe Budget requests $971\\xa0million in discretionary budget authority for 2025, a 25-percent \\nincrease over the 2021 enacted level at the beginning of the Administration.  The Budget \\ncontinues to build on the historic small business growth achieved under this Administration by \\nexpanding access to capital, counseling services, contracting opportunities, and disaster recovery \\nassistance.132 SMALL BUSINeSS ADMINISTRATION\\n• Invests in Innovators.   The Budget provides $30\\xa0million to support SBA’s Growth Accelerator \\nFund Competition, Regional Innovation Clusters, and the Federal and State Technology \\nPartnership Program to provide entrepreneurs at various technical readiness levels with a \\nnetwork of technical assistance providers including accelerators, State and local economic \\ndevelopment agencies, colleges and universities, and other technology-based economic devel -\\nopment entities.  This technical assistance provides small business entrepreneurs access to \\nthe tools, networks, and services they need to commercialize cutting-edge innovation and bring \\nsolutions to the market.\\n• Invests in Veteran-Owned Small Businesses.   In January 2023, SBA began accepting \\napplications for the Veteran Small Business Certification program to expand small business \\ncontracting opportunities for veterans.  The Budget provides $16\\xa0million to support this im -\\nportant program, including the cost to review certification and recertification applications for \\nveteran and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses.133SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION\\nThe President’s 2025 Budget:  \\n• Protects the Benefits that Americans Have Earned.   The Administration is commit -\\nted to protecting and strengthening Social Security and opposes any attempt to cut Social \\nSecurity benefits as well as proposals to privatize Social Security.  The Administration be -\\nlieves that protecting Social Security should start with asking the highest-income Americans \\nto pay their fair share.  In addition, the Administration supports efforts to improve Social \\nSecurity benefits, as well as Supplemental Security Income benefits, for seniors and people \\nwith disabilities, especially for those who face the greatest challenges making ends meet. \\n• Improves Service Delivery.   The Administration is committed to improving service deliv -\\nery for the more than six\\xa0million retirement, survivor, and Medicare claimants, as well as the \\nmore than two million individuals applying for disability and Supplemental Security Income \\nevery year.  The Budget provides an increase of $1.3\\xa0billion, nine percent over the 2023 en -\\nacted level, to improve customer service at SSA’s field offices, State disability determination \\nservices, and teleservice centers for retirees, individuals with disabilities, and their families.  \\nThe Budget also improves access to SSA’s services by reducing wait times.\\n• Provides National, Comprehensive Paid Family and Medical Leave. \\xa0 The vast major -\\nity of America’s workers do not have access to employer-provided paid family leave, including \\n73 percent of private sector workers.  Among the lowest-paid workers, who are dispropor -\\ntionately women and workers of color, 94 percent lack access to paid family leave through \\ntheir employers.  In addition, as many as one in five retirees leave the workforce earlier than \\nplanned to care for an ill family member, which negatively impacts families, as well as the \\nNation’s labor supply and productivity.  The Budget proposes to establish a national, compre -\\nhensive paid family and medical leave program administered by SSA.\\xa0 The program would:  \\nprovide workers with progressive, partial wage replacement to take time off for family and \\nmedical reasons; include robust administrative funding; and use an inclusive family defini -\\ntion.  The Budget would provide up to 12 weeks of leave to allow eligible workers to take time The Social Security Administration (SSA) is responsible for providing essential benefits to \\nretirees, survivors, individuals with disabilities, and older Americans with limited income and \\nresources, helping Americans retire with dignity.  The President’s 2025 Budget for SSA supports \\ninvestments in improving service delivery and advancing equity and proposes a national paid \\nfamily and medical leave program that would give workers the time they need to care for \\nthemselves or a loved one or to bond with a new child.\\nThe Budget requests $15.4\\xa0billion in discretionary budget authority for 2025, a $1.3\\xa0billion or \\n8.9-percent increase from the 2023 level, including cap adjustment funding. 134 SOCIAL SeCURITY ADMINISTRATION\\noff to:  care for and bond with a new child; care for a seriously ill loved one; heal from their own \\nserious illness; address circumstances arising from a loved one’s military deployment; or find \\nsafety from domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking—otherwise known \\nas “safe leave.”  The Budget would also provide up to three days to grieve the death of a loved \\none.\\xa0 The Administration looks forward to continuing to work with the Congress to make this \\ncritical investment and strengthen America’s economy. \\n• Advances Equity and Accessibility.   The Administration is committed to making it easier \\nfor people to access the services they rely on, including individuals experiencing homeless -\\nness, children with disabilities, and people with mental health and intellectual disabilities.  \\nThe Budget makes investments to decrease customer wait times, to simplify Supplemental \\nSecurity Income application processes, and to expand access to Agency programs and services, \\nparticularly for underserved communities.  SSA will also continue to modernize its informa -\\ntion technology systems to make more services available online and improve 800 Number \\naccess for those who call.  The Budget also prioritizes actions to prevent overpayments and to \\nallow customers to navigate the recovery and waiver processes more easily. 135Summary TablesBUDGeT OF THe U. S.

Funding Levels for Appropriated (“Discretionary”) Programs by Category—Continued\\n(Budget authority in billions of dollars)\\n*  Less than $500 million.\\n1  The 2023 actual level includes changes that occur after appropriations are enacted that are part of budget execution such as transfers, reestimates, and the rebasing as mandatory \\nany changes in mandatory programs (CHIMPs) enacted in appropriations bills.  The 2023 levels are adjusted to add back OMB’s scoring of CHIMPs enacted in 2023 appropriations \\nacts for a better illustrative comparison with the 2025 request.\\n2  At the time the 2025 Budget was prepared, 2024 appropriations remained incomplete and the 2024 column reflects at the account level enacted full-year and annualized continuing \\nappropriations provided under the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2024 (Division A of Public Law 118–15, as amended) (“the 2024 CR”).  The 2024 levels are further adjusted \\nthrough allowances to illustratively reflect a “likely enacted” level to account for the appropriations topline deal reached by Congressional Leadership in January 2024.\\n3  Base funding includes certain amounts designated as emergency requirements that are for base activities.  These amounts are described as “shifted base” in numerous budget \\nmaterials.\\n4  The 2025 Budget proposes to shift the Indian Health Service (IHS) and the CMS Survey and Certification Program in HHS, as well as contract support costs and 105(l) leases \\nwithin the Bureau of Indian Programs (BIA) in the Department of the Interior to the mandatory side of the Budget starting in 2026.   See the “Budget Process” chapter of the \\nAnalytical Perspectives  volume of the Budget for more information on these proposals.\\n5  The 2025 Budget presents enacted and proposed cap adjustments such as emergency requirements, program integrity, disaster relief, wildfire suppression, and other appropriations \\nexempted from budget enforcement outside of base allocations.\\n6  The section presents base discretionary funding by both defense and non-defense and by security and nonsecurity allocations.  The definition of security and nonsecurity is the \\nsame as the definition specified in the Budget Control Act of 2011 with security including the Departments of Defense, Homeland Security, Veterans Affairs, the National Nuclear \\nSecurity Administration, the International Budget Function (150), and the Intelligence Community Management Account and with all other discretionary programs in the \\nnonsecurity category.  This presentation of discretionary excludes the proposed shifts to mandatory.  After 2025, the Administration proposes that the Veterans Affairs Medical Care \\nProgram be budgeted for separately from the rest of non-defense programs given its anomalous growth pattern.  See the “Budget Process” chapter of the  Analytical Perspectives  \\nvolume of the Budget for more information on this proposal.\\n7  The amounts in the 2025 Budget are based on the National Security and National Defense strategies and the Department of Defense Future Years Defense Program, which \\nincludes a five-year appropriations plan and estimated expenditures necessary to support the programs, projects, and activities of the Department of Defense.  After 2029, the \\nBudget reflects outyear growth rates consistent with prior Budgets.\\n8  Section 905(c) of division J of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (Public Law 117–58; IIJA) specified that amounts provided in division J should be considered as \\nemergency discretionary appropriations.  The amounts provided as discretionary appropriations in IIJA are summarized here, however, these amounts are kept separate from \\nother discretionary amounts included above that are considered during the regular appropriations process.BUDGeT OF THe U.

The 2023 levels are adjusted to add back OMB’s scoring of CHIMPs enacted in 2023 appropriations \\nacts for a better illustrative comparison with the 2025 request.\\n2  At the time the 2025 Budget was prepared, 2024 appropriations remained incomplete and the 2024 column reflects at the account level enacted full-year and annualized continuing \\nappropriations provided under the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2024 (Division A of Public Law 118–15, as amended) (“the 2024 CR”).  The 2024 levels are further adjusted \\nthrough allowances to illustratively reflect a “likely enacted” level to account for the appropriations topline deal reached by Congressional Leadership in January 2024.\\n3  Base funding includes certain amounts designated as emergency requirements that are considered to be for base activities.  These amounts are described as “shifted base” in \\nnumerous budget materials.\\n4  Funding for Food for Peace Title II Grants is included in the State and International Programs total.  Although the funds are appropriated to the Department of Agriculture, the \\nfunds are administered by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID).   \\n5  Funding from the Hospital Insurance and Supplementary Medical Insurance trust funds for administrative expenses incurred by the Social Security Administration that support \\nthe Medicare program are included in the Health and Human Services total and not in the Social Security Administration total. \\n6  The State and International Programs total includes funding for the Department of State, USAID, Treasury International, and 11 international agencies while the Treasury total \\nexcludes Treasury’s International Programs.\\n7  The limitation enacted and proposed in the Justice Department’s Crime Victims Fund program and cancellations in the Children’s Health Insurance Program in HHS and the \\nNonrecurring expenses Fund in Commerce make up the bulk of these offsets.\\n8  The 2024 column includes several emergency supplemental funding requests that the Administration has submitted to the Congress including all amounts requested in its \\nNational Security Supplemental Request for Ukraine, Israel, humanitarian aid, and border and other national security funding that was transmitted on October 20, 2023, as well \\nas additional amounts for domestic needs, including disaster-related funding, that was informally submitted on October 25, 2023.\\n9  This columns reflects appropriations enacted in the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 (Public Law 118–5; FRA); these appropriations are considered to be outside of base totals.\\n10  The exempted funds column reflects amounts that are not counted for purposes of budget enforcement which includes 21st Century Cures appropriations in HHS, the Bipartisan \\nSafer Communities Act advance appropriations, certain revenues provided for the ePA Superfund, and the Corps’ Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund appropriations.  These amounts \\nare not counted as part of base totals.\\n11  The defense and non-defense base totals, excluding shifted base funding for 2024 and 2025, tie to the statutory discretionary caps enacted in the FRA.\\n12  The non-defense base program level includes shifted base funding and adjusts for certain offsets included in the Budget that are part of the FRA agreement to provide non-defense \\nresources above the FRA caps.\\nNote:  Section 905(c) of division J of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (Public Law 117–58; IIJA) specified that amounts provided in division J should be considered as \\nemergency discretionary appropriations.
