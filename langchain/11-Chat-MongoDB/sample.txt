Below are several sample user questions related to the MongoDB document provided, 
and the corresponding MongoDB aggregation pipeline queries that can be used to fetch the desired data.
Use them wisely.

Question 1: List all easy difficulty tours with rating above 4.5

Query:
[
  { 
    "$match": { 
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "ratingsAverage": { "$gt": 4.5 }
    }
  },
  {
    "$project": {
      "name": 1,
      "ratingsAverage": 1,
      "price": 1,
      "_id": 0
    }
  }
]

Question 2: What are the average prices for tours grouped by difficulty level?

Query:
[
  {
    "$group": {
      "_id": "$difficulty",
      "averagePrice": { "$avg": "$price" },
      "count": { "$sum": 1 }
    }
  },
  { "$sort": { "averagePrice": -1 } }
]

Question 3: Find tours starting between April and June 2021

Query:
[
  {
    "$match": {
      "startDates": {
        "$elemMatch": {
          "$gte": ISODate("2021-04-01"),
          "$lt": ISODate("2021-07-01")
        }
      }
    }
  },
  {
    "$project": {
      "name": 1,
      "startDates": 1,
      "_id": 0
    }
  }
]

Question 4: Get tours with duration 5 days or less, sorted by price

Query:
[
  {
    "$match": {
      "duration": { "$lte": 5 }
    }
  },
  {
    "$sort": { "price": 1 }
  },
  {
    "$project": {
      "name": 1,
      "duration": 1,
      "price": 1,
      "_id": 0
    }
  }
]


Each of these queries is designed to run within MongoDB's aggregation framework to extract specific information based on the user's questions.
 The `$project` step is used to format the output to include only relevant fields.
